Indian Visa Application Center (IVAC) Bangladesh

IVACs at five locations - namely Dhaka, Chittagong, Rajshahi, Sylhet and Khulna - have started offering limited appointment slots for Bangladesh nationals requiring urgent medical and other visas of emergency nature. In addition, these five IVAC centres have also opened limited appointment slots for urgent cases where Bangladesh students and workers need to travel to third countries and for which they already have visa appointments with foreign embassies in India. Please note that these services will remain limited in nature until IVAC resumes its normal operations at a later date.

Applicants seeking medical visa should visit the designated hospital only for which visa has been issued. Change in Hospital requires permission of FRRO. Change of hospital without the approval of FRRO tantamount to violation of visa regulations and may lead to imposition of restriction on travel to india in future.

Applicants are requested to thoroughly follow the visa guidelines before initiating application. They are encouraged to apply themselves to ensure correctness of the information provided in the application form to avoid rejection on grounds of incorrect/incomplete information .Indian visa system operates without any unauthorized intermediary. Applicants, are therefore, strictly advised and cautioned to refrain from approaching or engaging any agents /touts for Indian visa.

Visa Processing Fees Charged By IVAC For Bangladeshi Nationals:

In view of the significant escalation in input and operational costs over the years, the visa processing fee for applications submitted at the Indian Visa Application Centres (IVAC) in Bangladesh will be revised to BDT 1,500 (all inclusive) with effect from 10.08.2025. This processing fee is a service charge levied by IVAC to facilitate visa application handling.

This is the first revision in the visa processing fee since 2018, and is necessitated to ensure continued improvement in the quality of service and infrastructure.

As per the existing policy, Government of India does not charge any visa fees to citizens of Bangladesh and the Indian visa continues to remain free of charge for all Bangladeshi nationals.
