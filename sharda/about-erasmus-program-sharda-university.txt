About Erasmus Program

The Erasmus program, also known as Erasmus+, is a European Union (EU) initiative that promotes international education and cultural exchange among students and academic staff. The main goal is to enhance the quality and relevance of higher education in Europe and increase mobility and cooperation between European countries.  It offers opportunities for students to study abroad at a partner university for three to twelve months, typically during undergraduate or graduate studies. Erasmus allows students to experience different academic systems, gain intercultural skills, and broaden their perspectives. Credits earned during the mobility period are generally recognized by their home institution.

In addition to student mobility, Erasmus supports the exchange of academic staff between universities, the development of joint study programs, and collaboration between higher education institutions across Europe. It promotes partnerships in education, training, youth, and sports.

Sharda University has recently completed an ERASMUS+ Mobility program for students and faculty with University of Dubrovnik, Croatia.
