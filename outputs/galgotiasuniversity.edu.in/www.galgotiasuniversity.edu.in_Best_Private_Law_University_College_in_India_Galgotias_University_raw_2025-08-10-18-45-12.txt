Prof. (Dr.) Aditya Tomer
I welcome you to the School of Law at Galgotias University!
The Law school, established in 2012, has rapidly evolved into a prominent center of legal education, nurturing legal professionals with a strong presence at the national level. Our guidance comes from an illustrious team, including Professor Emeritus Justice JR Midha, Rodney D. Ryder, Shri Pawan Reley and many other distinguished judges, advocates, and academicians.
The school of Law has been a pioneer in grooming modern day legal professionals with a multi-disciplinary approach. It offers undergraduate programs like B.A.LL.B.(Hons) and B.B.A.LL.B.(Hons), along with a three-year LL.B. program, with specializations in areas such as Corporate Law, Intellectual Property Law, Criminal Law, and Constitutional Law. The objective is to create lawyers who are not only professionally adept but also attuned to the needs of society and the industry. The institution further provides a one-year LL.M. postgraduate program and opportunities for doctoral research, focusing on comprehensive research work.
The school of Law focuses on both knowledge sharing and honing practical skills through a variety of extra-curricular activities and specialized Value-Added courses. The school actively engages in various outreach initiatives including the Legal Aid and Mediation Centre with trained Para-legal Volunteers, Disability Rights Clinic and the adoption of the Village Dankaur in the District, among others.
GUSOL is committed to fostering Industry-Academia orientation and partnerships with national and international Law Firm and Professionals. Many legal luminaries including professionals, judges and advocates of Supreme Court, High Court and Tribunals, corporate legal experts regularly visit the school and share insights on the legal profession and interact with the law students.
The school regularly hosts events like Moot Court competitions, Trial Advocacy Competitions and other events with significant achievements recognised by notable figures like India’s current Law Minister, Mr. Kiren Rijuju.
The Placement and Internship Cell works assiduously to provide the best placement opportunities to match the skills and interests of the students. Many of our students have interned at Tier-I Law firms and received pre-placement offers from reputed law firms.
The faculty comes from prestigious institutions like National Law Schools, University of Delhi, South Asian University, Jamia Millia Islamia and eminent Liberal Arts Institutions. The School of Law has adopted a multi-disciplinary approach to integrate the legal knowledge which helps in chiseling the legal professionals.
We at the School of Law leave no stone unturned in shaping the budding lawyers who are socially relevant, techno-conversant and legally sound.
