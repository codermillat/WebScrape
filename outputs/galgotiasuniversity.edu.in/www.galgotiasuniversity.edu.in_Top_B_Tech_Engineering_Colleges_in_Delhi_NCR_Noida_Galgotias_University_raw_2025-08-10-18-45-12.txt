It was a great journey. Electrical department teachers were really supportive over my 4 years in college. With theoretical knowledge I also experienced a lot of practical knowledge that helped me build my courier and improve my communication skills as well. They helped me build critical thinking and provide new ideas .
Other than syllabus , the extra activities like research paper writing, patents etc. The workshops that were conducted helped me a lot in building my resume. The structure of examination which includes presentation helped to improve communication skills which helped me in my interviews.
Activities such as research paper writing and patent filing, as well as the workshops, were beneficial in enhancing my resume. The practical experience gained through research paper writing, patent filing, and presentations, allowed me to develop a deeper understanding of the subject matter, and provided me with valuable skills that are high . Additionally, the examination format, which included presentations, helped me improve my communication skills, which in turn proved to be useful during my job interviews.
Having started with Galgotias University School of Electrical, Electronics and Communications Engineering in August 2018. I graduated with a first-class degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering. This journey was made possible through the tireless efforts of some of the most decorated and resilient professors from the dept of DEECE. Coping with covid-19 constraints while trying to meet the demands of the program requirements was a challenge which we took head-on as a team cooperatively right till the end of the era. EECE provided a conducive and competitive platform to shape me into a world class engineer. The flipped class delivery system enabled me among others to express the pinnacle of my capabilities, allowing my faculties to mold me into the professional that I have become today. Today I stand proud among other engineers, holding my head high, knowing that my input and opinion at meetings is always treated with priority and respect.
