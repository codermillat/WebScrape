Prof. (Dr.) Manish Raj
Welcome to the School of Artificial Intelligence at Galgotias University, where we are shaping the future of technology through innovation, creativity, and transformative education. As the Dean, I am pleased to lead a dynamic community dedicated to advancing the frontiers of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and preparing our students to thrive in an AI-driven world.
AI is no longer just a technology; it is a catalyst for change across industries, from healthcare, Agriculture, digital Twin, Extended reality and finance to sustainable development and creative arts. Our curriculum is designed to embrace the latest advancements in AI, including generative models, reinforcement learning, edge AI, and ethical AI frameworks. We emphasize futuristic approaches such as human-AI collaboration, explainable AI, and quantum machine learning, ensuring our students are equipped to tackle global challenges with cutting-edge solutions.
At Galgotias, we champion active learning to foster critical thinking and hands-on expertise. Through project-based learning, hackathons, industry collaborations, and research-driven initiatives, our students engage with real-world problems, building skills in AI model development, data analytics, and responsible innovation. Our state-of-the-art labs and partnerships with leading tech organizations provide a vibrant ecosystem for experiential learning.
Our vision is to nurture not just technologists but visionary leaders who will harness AI for societal good. With a focus on interdisciplinary learning, we integrate AI with fields like robotics, IoT, and cybersecurity to prepare students for diverse career paths.
Join us at the School of AI to embark on a transformative journey, where your passion for technology meets limitless possibilities. Together, let’s build a future where AI empowers humanity.
