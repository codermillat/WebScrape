Amity Scholarship Scheme
Financing for Intellectual Empowerment
Amity has always been driven by the vision of Dr. Ashok K. Chauhan to develop the next
generation of leadership for organisations, communities and society at large. As a part
of his vision, the Amity Scholarships
were instituted to help those who are brilliant in academics and those who deserve
world-class education but don’t have the means.
At Amity, we believe in rewarding the hard work and excellence achieved by meritorious
students in their academic endeavors. Over 50,000 meritorious students
have been awarded Amity
Scholarships.
The Amity Scholarships have been initiated to encourage the talents of such students,
thereby strengthening the roots of our future generation, a small step towards the
collective goal of making India the
knowledge superpower of the world.
