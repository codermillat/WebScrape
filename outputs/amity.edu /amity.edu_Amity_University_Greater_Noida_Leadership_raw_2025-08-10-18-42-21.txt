Amity has always been driven by the vision of Dr. Ashok K. Chauhan to develop the next generation of leadership for organisations, communities and society at large.

At Amity, we believe in rewarding the hard work and excellence achieved by meritorious students in their academic endeavors. Over 50,000 meritorious students have been awarded Amity Scholarships.
The Amity Scholarships have been initiated to encourage the talents of such students, thereby strengthening the roots of our future generation, a small step towards the collective goal of making India the knowledge superpower of the world.
