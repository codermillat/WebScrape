Amity University Uttar Pradesh
Dear Future Leaders,
Greetings from Amity University!
It is a matter of immense pleasure for me to be a part of the prestigious Amity University Uttar Pradesh, Greater Noida, an Atulyam Campus of Amity Education Group.
Amity Education Group over the last 30 years has established 11 universities and 25 schools in India and across the world with over 175,000 students enrolled.The world-class campuses of Amity, spread over 1000
acres, are in India and globally in London, New York, Singapore, Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Sharjah, San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam, Tashkent, and South Africa.
Amity’s flagship University is ranked among the top 3% universities globally by QS and THE (the world’s leading university ranking organizations) and has set a new standard of academic excellence by becoming
Asia’s only University to achieve US Regional Accreditation and by UK’s Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education (QAA).
Amity also has India’s leading chain of schools with 20 top-ranked schools and 5 Preschools in India in New Delhi, Delhi NCR, Mumbai, Lucknow, Mohali, Gwalior and Naya Raipur, and globally in Amsterdam, Abu
Dhabi, Dubai and Sharjah that follow the British, IB and the Indian CBSE curriculum.
Amity has some of the most talented and dedicated thought leaders in the country who come from the best institutions around the world. Not only are they academically and professionally amongst the best, but have high
standards of moral and ethical values, so that they can be true role models.
At Amity, emphasis is given on not only making you academically brilliant, but true leaders and team players, thus preparing you for the real-life corporate world. Amity has got a strong connection with the industry.
At regular intervals, Amity keeps on updating its curriculum with the changing market needs and advancements needed to be done in accordance with the UGC. Amity has many unique programmes like the Military Training
Camps which comprise activities like parasailing, trekking, shooting, and many other activities that test your mental and physical agility. To help students in personal grooming, special sessions are held on business
etiquette, negotiation skills, and effective communication. To help our students to become efficient team members and effective leaders, students undergo special classes on leadership, teamwork, and analytical
skills. Students at Amity also become active members of a club/committee that brings about their true potential and aptitude helping them in their future careers.
In addition to this, Yoga, and military training (including shooting, parasailing, and other adventure sports) are an integral part of personality development at Amity.
Tee education framework at Amity is rooted in certain key values and ethics. It stresses principles such as patriotism, courage, and respect for elders. It is this sense of purpose that has led to the creation of the
'101 Attributes of an Amitian'. This explores 101 different character traits that take an individual closer to completeness. The attributes have been built into the teaching activities and group activities and have
been included in topics for lectures and discussions by students.
I wish and assure you, on behalf of the entire Amity Education Group, that we will help you pursue your goals in life in the varied social, cultural, and economic environment and make the University family proud of
