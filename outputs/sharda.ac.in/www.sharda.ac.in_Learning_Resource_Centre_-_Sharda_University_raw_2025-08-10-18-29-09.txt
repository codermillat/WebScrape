Synonymous with the abode of knowledge, Swami Vivekananda Library and all other school libraries at Sharda University are stocked with more than 1.5 Lac of books and thousands of Print journals to ignite the wisdom growth of the students. Library is frequently updated with new books and other useful study material for students from diverse streams.
In our quest to make the Library management immensely convenient for the users, Sharda University Library provides vital support complementing academic activities to students, researchers and staff. We arrange access to the world of information - whether online, multimedia or in print. In order to effectively capitalize on the opportunities provided by radical changes to technology, pedagogy and research practice, the libraries operate in a number of profound ways and work in partnership with faculty members to enhance student’s research skill development, encompassing both information literacy and learning skills. The libraries now do provide effective research and learning environments with a user-focused approach which is the hallmark of SU library.
