TEACHING METHODS ADOPTED TO IMPROVE STUDENT LEARNING RESOURCES AVAILABLE AT DEPARTMENT LEVELS:
• Infrastructural Facilities: LMS / ICT and IMPARTUS Lecture Capturing / Recording
• MOOC Courses
• Project/ Research Based Learning
To enhance both the learning experience and academic performance of students, course materials, modules, and lesson plans are seamlessly accessible through iCloud. Furthermore, the teaching and learning process in the classroom is bolstered by the utilization of ICT-enabled facilities.
IMPARTUS Lecture Capturing / Recording
Impartus offers cutting-edge video-based educational solutions that significantly enhance educational outcomes for institutions. Impartus is a comprehensive video learning platform that revolutionizes the teaching and learning experience. Through Impartus, educators can effortlessly capture, edit, and share contextually relevant content. Students benefit from a deeper comprehension of their coursework by accessing recorded or live-streamed class lectures and supplemental materials anytime, from anywhere. The primary goals are to ensure continuous live and interactive teacher-student engagement during the ongoing pandemic, develop video lecture capture for an online digital library, and provide innovative video-based learning solutions to enhance educational institution performance.
The school encourages students to establish various clubs and societies or department-level student chapters, overseen by faculty, to promote holistic development through experiential learning. Students receive support in organizing a wide range of extracurricular, technical activities, and industrial visits, allowing all students to actively participate, fulfil their aspirations, and expand their horizons beyond the confines of traditional classroom learning.
Model Based Teaching:
Faculty members use models wherever required to explain the content such as explaining the reinforcement in structure for estimations etc. Models based teaching for the subjects are planned before the starting of the semester. The has an added advantage of motivating the students and making them interactive It also influences the students to work their own models for their mini projects. Animation videos /graphics /videos are used for explaining topics such as field testing methods in civil engineering.
Details of Few Innovation Practices in Teaching and learning by faculties
S. No. | Faculty Name | Course Handled | Innovation Practices in Teaching and Learning | Remarks
1 | Ms. Megha Gupta | CVP461
Advanced Structural Design Lab | Students were given project in which they have to design an existing multi storey structure exposed to various loading conditions. Furthermore, they were asked to make a presentation using the designing of the structure and were tested for their understanding about the differences and importance of the theoretical structural knowledge. The entire exercise was considered as a project and was evaluated for their CA. | The complete structural designing of a structure provided a great insight to the student as it helps in understanding the real life designing challenges that is faced by the civil engineers at site.
2 | Col. Vivek Mathur | CVP106
Introduction to Civil Engineering | Students are encouraged to present their views about the various specializations in Civil Engineering along with the future aspects in construction they were made to read the news related to the present construction techniques. Students are also exposed to Ethics in construction by an experienced Civil Engineers and Alumni | The students become more confident by knowing the vast opportunities available to them.
3 | Col. Vivek Mathur, Col. Narendar Sharma | CVL330
Introduction to Transportation Engineering | Real world traffic problems were given to the students as assignments to develop a wholesome idea of transportation engineering. Students were motivated to evaluate the various concepts that from the course and to put into use to suggest effective measures to the problem since they were trying to find solutions to real –life problems this exercise will be fruitful to them when they meet with similar challenges as a practicing engineer. | Based on the innovative approach in teaching Transportation Engineering, students were able to solve the traffic congestion problem at Pari Chowk, Greater Noida. A detailed report of the study along with their feasible solutions were given to Greater Noida Authority.

Based on the innovative approach in teaching Transportation Engineering, students were able to solve the traffic congestion problem at Pari Chowk, Greater Noida. A detailed report of the study along with their feasible solutions were given to Greater Noida Authority.
Amidst the pandemic, the University seamlessly transitioned to online learning through diverse digital platforms. Both the University and its departments are well-prepared to embrace blended learning in the future. Faculty members have diligently uploaded a wealth of e-content, including audio and video sessions, study materials, presentations, and class recordings, accessible to all students. Additionally, the campus boasts 24/7 high-speed Wi-Fi connectivity, ensuring uninterrupted access to online classes, webinars, and extracurricular activities.

• Structural Analysis Lab: Structural analysis laboratory aims at modelling structural systems in the engineering domain and observing their mechanical behaviours. The lab is equipped with modern as well as traditional equipment for performing different experiments. Some equipment amongst the lot present in the laboratory are Shear Force & Bending Moment Analysis Apparatus, Analysis of Two Hinged and Three-Hinged Arches, Deflection of Curved Members.
• Environmental Engineering Lab: The lab is well-equipped for characterisation and quality analysis of water and wastewater. Composed of both wet-lab and digital instruments, the lab caters to environmental engineering and environmental chemistry aspects of our raw/drinking water supplies and municipal/industrial sewage. Some of the salient equipment includes digital meters for measuring pH, turbidity, total dissolved solids and dissolved oxygen; instant residual chlorine kit; COD apparatus and Jar-test assembly for optimal coagulant dose.
• The Building Materials Lab: The laboratory offers facilities for testing building materials for their strength, behaviour and suitability for various applications. The laboratory also provides material testing services, building material testing services, refractory material testing services and geological material testing services.
• Soil Mechanics Lab: The space for this laboratory is well equipped with all instruments required for identification and classification of soils (w.r.t. physical and chemical properties) and strength testing of soil samples.
• Survey: This laboratory houses all the sophisticated instruments viz. Electronic Total Station, GPS, Theodolite, Auto levels, Vernier Theodolite, Digital Planimeter, Dumpy Levels, in addition to other fundamental equipment such as Chain, Tape, Compass, and Plane Table.
• Water Resources/ Hydrology/ Hydraulics: This is a combined laboratory equipped with flow measuring devices in pipes and flow measurements in open channels. Facilities are available for calibration of flow measuring devices as well as pressure testing of pipes and pumps. The types of equipment in the lab are Reynolds apparatus with coloured die injector arrangement, Metacentric height apparatus, Pipe friction apparatus, Bernoulli's theorem apparatus, Loss in pipe fitting apparatus, Venturimeter and Orifice meter for flow measurement, Impact of jet apparatus, Notch apparatus, Darcy's law apparatus and Surface tension apparatus.
• Concrete Lab: Facilities and equipment are available for handling and preparation of concrete, for testing Wet concrete properties, Temperature controlled ovens, In-situ Property Evaluation of concrete; Concrete core-cutting machine.
• CAD/ CAM/ Geo-Informatics: This laboratory is an extension of the Engineering Drawing lab. In this, the students are taught working proficiency in CAD programs, such as AutoCAD and Pro/ENGINEER. This also has software for analysing the spatial data for GeoInformatics analysis.
• Transportation Lab: The Transportation Engineering laboratory of the Civil Engineering focuses on transport related issues. The lab aims at promoting applied research and new methodologies in the field of Transportation Engineering. The lab is equipped with equipment for conducting field and laboratory tests on Subgrade, Aggregates, Bituminous Materials and Bituminous Mixes; facilities for conducting traffic studies; facilities for assessing pavement performance and cyclic loading test equipment.
The department is in the process of developing other labs which shall be needed for the coming years.
