To reach the mark, it needs to evolve systems and mechanisms to convert the present demographic dividend into high quality technical human resource capable of doing cutting edge research and innovation and deep-tech entrepreneurship. Sharda Entrepreneurial Ecosystem is an integral part of the Vision and Mission of Sharda University to nurture innovation and entrepreneurship. This is in line with the flagship initiatives of Government of India starting with Star-up India, Atal Innovation Mission to Aatmanirbhar Bharat.The University aims to foster innovations leading to design and development of new products, processes and technologies in congruence with industry and research organization. With this objective, the Sharda University Innovation and Startup Policy 2020 (SU-ISP 2020) has been framed and implemented across all verticals of the University in cognizance with NISP and Startup Policy of Govt. of Uttar Pradesh. SU-ISP is a guiding framework to envision aneducational system oriented towards startups and entrepreneurship opportunities for student and faculties.The guidelines provide ways for developing entrepreneurial agenda, managing IntellectualProperty Rights (IPR) ownership, technology licensing and equity sharing in Startups or enterprisesestablished by Item no. 21.27; Annexure-24

faculty and students.In order to achieve the cultural and attitudinal shiftand to ensure that ‘Innovation and Startup’ culture is the primary fulcrum of our higher education system apolicy framework and guidelines are the need of this hour.These guidelines will enable institutions to activelysupport their faculty, staff and students to participate in innovation and entrepreneurship (I&E) relatedactivities, thus encouraging students and faculty to consider startups and entrepreneurship as a career option.These guidelines will alsohelp emphasize that the entrepreneurship is all about creating a business, which is financially successful. Sharda University has more than 9,000 students and 700facultywho are actively engaged in research and innovation driven projects and activities. The objective of this policy is to explore and support and nurture these innovations catering to form the base for self- sustained startup ecosystem. The policy aspires to promotestudent, working professionals and job seeker innovators incubating into startups. The policy is aimed to nurture sector agnostic innovation, knowledge, skills, technological development, infrastructure and investment resulting in entrepreneurial ventures. Implementation of the policy will create an environment conducive to origination of ideas and their incubation into business and enable the University to emerge as a vibrant startup ecosystem and attract entrepreneurs and investors across the country. A committee having members from diverse domains and expertise was constituted by Sharda University to formulatedetailed guidelines on various aspects related to Innovation, Startup and Entrepreneurship management. Thiscommittee deliberated on different facets for nurturing the innovation and Startup culture in HEIs, whichcovered Intellectual Property ownership, revenue sharing mechanisms, norms for technology transfer andcommercialization, equity sharing, etc. After multiple rounds of brainstorming sessions and discussion with the experts from I&E ecosystem stakeholders, SU-ISP 2020 for students and faculties of the University has been prepared. (1) Strategies and Governancefor Promoting Innovation and Entrepreneurship Academic and research institutions around the world have been the primary source of basicresearch contributing towards the expansion of knowledge base, leading to remarkablediscoveries in multiple domains. Given the critical role that the University level research and academics haveplayed in fostering innovation in young minds, the Government of India and Government of Uttar Pradesh has set the following goals inthis sector- 1. Shift from a marks-driven to an innovation powered educational system 2. Establish an entrepreneur friendly academic apparatus 3. Create a barrier free environment for free flow of ideas 4. Engagement with industry and successful entrepreneurs to promote innovation and startup culture. 5. Encourage startups by giving special incentives to students and faculty. Identifying Academia as a principal point of origin of game-changing ideas, Sharda University aims to further augment University research and academic provisions throughstructured programs and incentives to the following sections-  Students, Innovators and Entrepreneurs  Startups Item no. 21.27; Annexure-24

 Pre-incubation and Incubation facilities  Skill building facilities (A) Core Objectives: Implementation of entrepreneurial vision at the University should be achieved through missionstatements rather than stringent control system. 1. To encourage, facilitate and support emergence of at least 20 startups every year in the University. 2. To extend scale-up support to at least 3 high growth startups developing innovative solutions of high social impact. 3. To develop and work with an extensive network of startup ecosystem stakeholders to help entrepreneurs launch and scaleinnovative companies. 4. To equip innovators with the entrepreneurship skills required to succeed, using skill building methodologies that transcend traditional learning. To achieve these goals, the University shall focus on 5-point agenda: 1. Develop physical infrastructure and incubation management capabilities. 2. Focus on sustainable funding models through capital funds and other instruments of support. 3. Support system for young innovators by including entrepreneurship and innovation based experimentation in early stages of enrolled academic program. 4. Proactive engagement with industry to identify problems and develop innovative solutions which can be adopted and implemented by the industry. 5. Encourage entrepreneurs through special incentives who are working in rural and social domain for the benefit of the society and improving quality of life in villages and unprivileged or underprivileged sections of the society. (B) Financial Strategy Resource mobilization plan has been worked out at the University level for supporting pre- incubation,incubation infrastructure and facilities. A sustainable financial strategy has been defined inorder toreduce the organizational constraints to work on the entrepreneurial agenda. Sharda University shall follow the four point financial strategy for this purpose. i. One of the major challenges for a startup is the lack of funds to commercialize his/her idea. As a consequence, most ideas generated in the minds of our youth don’t even go into the prototype development phase. Lack of funding is a crucial bottleneck in the innovation ecosystem. Investment in the entrepreneurial activities has been included as a part of the institutional financial strategy. Minimum 1% fund of the total annual budget of the institution should be allocated for funding and supporting innovation and startup related activities through creation of separate ‘Innovation Fund’ - a fund that will function as a master fund. The University shall leverage the expertise of senior officials involved in startup ecosystem including faculty, incubation managers, corporate network and Government agencies, and constitute a panel – ‘Innovation Fund Council’ to decide the nature and amount of fund utilization. Thefund shall be managed by a professional fund manager. The structure of ‘Innovation Fund Council is as follows: Item no. 21.27; Annexure-24

a) Vice Chancellor - Chairman b) Pro-Vice Chancellor – Convenor c) Dean or Senior Professor from SET, SMSR (Dean/Senior Professor of other schools shall be the invited members in the meetings of this Council) d) NISP Coordinator e) IIC President f) Representative from Incubation Facility of the University ii. A part of the Innovation Fund shall be used as ‘Seed Innovation’ fund to fund the innovators at the idea or pre-seed stage for prototyping. This fund is aimed at encouraging innovators who need early stage funding to work on their research discoveries, college project ideas etc. Innovation Seed Fund aims to ease the costs incurred at an early stage such as company registration, patent filing, quality certifications, travel etc. The fund shall be disbursed either throughthe ‘Innovation Fund Council’of the University or one of the constituted incubators.Such early stage innovators shall be given the privilege to register themselves as willing-to-be entrepreneurs with an incubator. iii. To reduce the dependency on internal funding, all efforts shall be made to bring funding from external Central and State Government sources such as DST, DBT, MHRD, AICTE, TDB, TIFAC, DSIR, CSIR, BIRAC, NSTEDB, NRDC, Startup India, Invest India, MeiTy, MSDE, MSME, etc. The funds received through such sources contributing to Innovation and Entrepreneurship (I & E) shall be utilized under a new initiative – ‘Phoenix Innovation’ Fund. iv. To support technology incubators, University may approach non-government sources and private and corporate sectors to generate funds, under Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) as per Section 135 of the Company Act 2013. Opportunities of sponsorships and donations shall be exploredto raise funds for I& E. Special recognition and reward mechanism shall be framed at the University level to promote such engagements. (C) I & E Promotion Strategy (i) Engagements of Alumni network shall be increased to promote I& E. Pre-incubation and Incubation facilities shall include special benefits in its policy and guidelines for Alumni who are willing to join the incubation facilities of the University. (ii) To expedite the decision making, hierarchical barriers should be minimized. For this purpose, Institution’s Innovation Council and Entrepreneurship Cell shall act as core I& E Promotion Council with autonomy and ownership of initiatives. (iii) Importance of I& E and five point agenda to achieve goals of this policy shall be well known across the institute. The Institution’s Innovation Council and Entrepreneurship Cell shall contribute major role in promotion of I & E. The same shall be highlighted during the institutional programs such as conferences, seminars, workshops, skill building programs etc. (v) The Institution’s Innovation Council and Entrepreneurship Cell shall take proactive initiatives in order to integrate the entrepreneurial activities across various schools, departments, special facility centres andfaculties within the university, thus breaking the silos. Item no. 21.27; Annexure-24

(vi) To support commercialization of product, service and technology developed by innovators and startups, product to market strategy shall be developed on case to case basis. (vii) Development of entrepreneurship culture should not be limited within the boundaries of the institution. The University shall strive to become the driving force in developing entrepreneurship culture in its vicinity (regional, state and national level). This shall include giving opportunity for regional startups,provision to extend facilities for outsiders and active involvement of the University in definingstrategic direction for local development. (viii) Strategic international partnerships should be developed using bilateral and multilateral channelswith national and international innovation clusters and other relevant organizations. Moreover, internationalexchange programs, internships, engaging the international faculties in teaching and researchshould also be promoted. (2) StartupEnablingInstitutionalInfrastructure The University shall anchor all its entrepreneurship related efforts to pre-incubation and incubation facilities for nurturing innovations and startups. Incubation and Innovation need to be organically interlinked. Without innovation, new enterprises are unlikely to succeed. The goal of the effort should be to link INNOVATION to ENTREPRISES to FINANCIALSUCCESS.These Pre-Incubation/Incubation facilities should be accessible 24x7 to students, staff and faculty of all disciplines and departments across the institution. The university may offer mentoring and other relevant services through Pre-incubation/Incubation facilities in-return for fees, equity sharing and (or) zero payment basis. The corresponding guidelines shall be prepared with direct involvement of authorized coordinators/in-charges, giving suitable autonomy to the facility.Dedicated webpage for innovation and entrepreneurship shall be created on the University website to disseminate information about these facilities. Innovation: Conceptually, any innovation implies substantial improvementin the ways of doing things, producing goods or providing services. It mayinvolve a new use of an existing resource or producing or delivering existinggoods or services through new methods or new instruments/materials. It is a process driven approach to identify and develop solution for industry and society. The University aims to identify and support innovative ideas of students, alumni, faculty and innovators from the outside community at various levels: (i) Proof-of-concept (POC) stage: Proof-of-concept is the stage where theinnovator/ startup demonstrate a fundamental functioning demonstrationof the idea/ hypothesis/ innovation. (ii) Prototype-stage: A prototype-stage is a pre-production/ pre-launch stagewhere the innovator/ startup team has developed a basic minimum viableproduct (MVP) with most key features desired in the final product. (iii) Minimum viable product (MVP): MVPis a product with just enough features togather validated learning about the product and its continued development. Laboratories and Research and development facilities of the University shall contribute to develop innovative ideas at various stages. Each school and central facilities shall identify the Item no. 21.27; Annexure-24

labs and available resources such as machines, equipment, software etc. which can be used to nurture innovation and support innovators in their entrepreneurial journey. A dedicated space in such identified facilities shall be assigned to promote and support innovation. List of such facilities shall be displayed on the website and enclosed as Annexure with this policy. Pre-incubation: Pre-incubation makes up the support systems towards theearly stage of the innovation & startup value chain that comprises anenabling environment to trigger creative ideas, hand-holding ideas atvalidate its early users, basic common working infrastructures, and accessto existing resources before the innovation reaches an enterprise stage. The University shall establish pre-incubation facilities such as Institution’s Innovation Council (as per guidelines of MoE Innovation Cell), Entrepreneurship Cell, Innovation Cell, Startup Cell, Student Clubs etc. Pre-incubation facilities may or may not be a separately registered entity or Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV).These facilities must have representation from all the schools, departments and facilities of the University including faculty, students and external experts. All pre-incubation facilities shall work in close coordination with a clear vision to create an innovationecosystem in and around the University. The facilities must ensure maximum engagement of the students with objective to identify and facilitate young innovators. Activity calendar in sync with University academic and activity calendar shall be prepared for such facilities and displayed on the webpage created for innovation and entrepreneurship. Incubation Facilities :Incubator is an organization established to accelerate thegrowth of startups, through an array of business support, resources,mentorship, networking and other common services such as physical space,capital, and coaching.Incubation and technology commercialization facilities shall be established as separate entities, preferably registered under Section-8 of Company Act 2013 or 'Society' registered under Society Registration Act, with independent governance structure. This will allow more freedom to Incubators in decision making with less administrative hassles for executing the programs related to innovation, IPR and Startups. Moreover, they will have better accountability towards investors supporting the incubation facility.The modalities regarding Equity Sharing in Startups supported through these units will depend upon the nature of services offered by these units and are elaborately i Sharda Launchpad Federation – a company registered under section 8, has been established as in-campus incubator of the University. A dedicated space of at least 5000 sq. ft.,with scope of expansion upto 10,000 sq.ft., has been allocated to Incubation facilities having basic infrastructure for office space and other enterprise related activities. Such facilities shall also be equipped with computing, prototyping and testing facilities for technology startups at POC stage. (3) Nurturing Innovations and Startups Process and mechanism, which support easy creation and nurturing of Startups/enterprises, are the key components for a vibrant and progressive innovation and startup ecosystem. Such initiatives attain their optimum efficiency when a pool of quality innovations and early stage startups emerge and grow on a regular basis. Sharda University aims to support entrepreneurial efforts by students (UG, PG, Ph.D.), staff (including temporary or project staff), faculty, alumni and potential start up applicants even from outside the institutions. Item no. 21.27; Annexure-24

i. Each school shall conduct ideation and innovation challenge/camp, half yearly. The entries shall be invited under three broad categories i.e. idea stage, prototype stage and minimum viable product (MVP) stage. All the participants shall be suitably supported based on their quality and stage of innovation by the facilities created as per guidelines given in section 2 of this policy. ii. For ease of process and autonomy, the pre-incubation and incubation facilities should be accessible to innovator or entrepreneur without the approval of any other authority external to the facility. The suggested methods to connect are – email, online form, written or printed application. The facilities shall issue their own process and guidelines regarding the same. iii. On registration of a student, faculty and staff with any pre-incubation and incubation facility, the timeframe to access the facilities shall be mutually decided between the facility and reporting department/school of the applicant. iv. The University and its facilities shall allow licensing of IPR from institute to its students and faculty intending to initiate a startup based on the technology developed or co- developed by them or the technology owned by the institute. The cost of license can be in terms of any of the below given forms, to be decided mutually. a)Equity in the venture b)License fee c)Royalty d) Sharing of revenue/funds raised v. Students, faculty and staff shall be allowed to work on their innovative projects and setting up startups in any domain and sector along with their studies and regular job. Students, faculty and staff can also work as intern or part-time with the incubated startups while studying/working. Norms for such involvement of students are mentioned further in this section and those for faculty/staff are mentioned separately in section 7. vi. Student Entrepreneurs may earn credits for working on innovative prototypes/Business Models/Ventures after proper assessment of the work done. The student must take approval from the competent authority through proper channel in the beginning of the term to avail any such credit benefit. vii. Student inventors may opt for startup in place of their mini project/major project, seminars, and summer trainings.The area in which student wants to initiate a startup may be interdisciplinary or multi- disciplinary. However, the student must describe how they will separate and clearly distinguish their ongoing research/academic activities as a student from the work being conducted at the startup. Prior approval from Dean Academics with the recommendations of the Dean of the School and registration at incubation facility is mandatory to avail this facility. viii. Students who are under incubation, pursuing some entrepreneurial ventures while studying may be allowed to use their address in the institute to register their company, if required, with the consent of the University after obtaining No Objection Certificate from the University. ix. Students entrepreneurs may be allowed to sit for the examination, even if their attendance is less than the minimum permissible percentage, with due permission from the institute.Verification from Incubation facilities (either in-campus or under State/Centre Government)would be required for the number of hours for which the student was engaged in entrepreneurial activity. Any self-declarationby the student or by private co- Item no. 21.27; Annexure-24

work space outside the University without permission through proper channel will not be admissible. x. Students may be allowed to take a year breakupto 1 year for N+1 programs and 2 years for N+2 programs (depending upon the decision of review committee constituted by the institute) to work on their startups and re-join academics to complete the course. Student entrepreneurs may earn academic credits for their efforts while creating an enterprise. The review committeemay include Dean Academics, Dean of the School, Program HOD and representative of Incubation Facility of the University. xi. The University may provide accommodation to the entrepreneurs within the campus for some period of time as per following guidelines: a) The accommodation for male and female entrepreneurs shall be provided according to the availability of rooms in Boys and Girls hostels. b) The hostel charges shall be applicable as per the rates notified by the Registrar for different hostels and the category of rooms. However the same will be calculated on a pro-rata basis according to the duration of stay. The charges would be calculated on a monthly basis irrespective of the number of days stayed in a particular month. c) The applicant should take prior approval from the Head of the Department and fill the hostel application form before allotment of room. xii. Faculty and staff shall be allowed to take off for a semester or year break as special case leave for working on startups and come back. This shall be guided by the HR policy of the University. Resourcesof the Universityshall be made available to faculty/students/staff wishing to establish start up as a fulltime effort. The operational and material cost of any resource or facility, which is available on payment basis, shall be applicable. xiii. The University aims to introducepart-time/full time MS/ MBA/ PGD (Innovation, entrepreneurship and venture development) program where one can get degree while incubating and nurturing a startup company. Schools shall refer to the guidelines issued by the Regulatory body for a similar programand propose to start such programs to the Academic Council. xiv. The University will facilitate the startup activities/ technology development by allowing students/ faculty/ staff to use infrastructure and facilities of the University, as per the choice of the potential entrepreneur in the following manners: a. Short-term/ six-month/ one-year part-time entrepreneurship training. b. Mentorship support on regular basis. c. Facilitation in a variety of areas including technology development, ideation, creativity, design thinking, fund raising, financial management, cash-flow management, new venture planning, business development, product development, social entrepreneurship, product- costing, marketing, brand-development, human resource management as well as law and regulations impacting a business. d. The University shall also link the startups to other seed-fund providers/ angel funds/ venture funds or itself may set up seed-fund once the incubation activities mature. e. License institute IPR as discussed in section 4 below. Item no. 21.27; Annexure-24

-- Page 10 --
xv. In return of the services and facilities, University may take 2% to 9.5% equity/ stake in the startup/ company, based on the brand used, faculty contribution, support provided and use of institute’s IPR (a limit of 9.5% is suggested so that Universityhas no legal liability arising out of startup. The institute should normally take much lower equity share, unless its full-time faculty/ staff have substantial shares). Other factors for consideration should be space, infrastructure, mentorship support, seed- funds, support for accounts, legal, patents etc. a) For staff and faculty, institute can take no-more than 20% of shares that staff / faculty takes while drawing full salary from the institution; however, this share will be within the 9.5% cap of company shares, listed above. b) No restriction on shares that faculty / staff can take, as long as they do not spend more than 20% of office time on the startup in advisory or consultative role and do not compromise with their existing academic and administrative work / duties. c) In case of compulsory equity model, student startup may be given a cooling period of 3 months to use incubation services on rental basis to take a final decision based on satisfaction of services offered by the University/incubator. xvi. The University should also provide services based on mixture of equity, fee-based and/ or zero payment model. So, a startup may choose to avail only the support, not seed funding, by the institute on rental basis. The incubation facilities shall frame their startup policy accordingly. xvii. The Universityshall extend the startup facility to alumni of the institute as well as outsiders. The terms of use may be defined suitably by the incubation facility. xviii. Participation in startuprelated activities needs to be considered as a legitimate activity of faculty in addition to teaching, R&D projects, industrial consultancy and management duties and must be considered while evaluating the annual performance of the faculty. Related guidelines and formats shall be included in the HR policy. Every faculty shall be encouraged to mentor at least one startup or innovative ideas of students. xix. Product development and commercialization as well as participating and nurturing of startups shall be added to a bucket of faculty-duties and each faculty would choose a mix and match of these activities and then respective faculty shall be evaluated accordingly for their performance and promotion.Performance evaluation policies for faculty and staff shall be updates/revisedaccordingly. xx. At no stage, any liabilitybecause of any activity of any startup must not accrue to the University and/or its incubation facilities. (4) Product Ownership Rights for Technologies Developed at Institute A key first step for the University is to establish relationships with the private sector etc. for the transition of secure technologies & to have a consistent and open IP strategy that is officially approved by the University authority and accessible to researchers and external stakeholders for consultation. In a variety of instances IP initiatives are the products of a participatory mechanism representing all primary players within the organization University IP laws usually protect all IP rights, in particular patents and copyrights, but can also include the transfer of know-how.The Brand Ownership Rights and their commercialization for technologies established at University are arranged & affixed in the manner enumerated herein. Item no. 21.27; Annexure-24

-- Page 11 --
(i) IP policy should be a complex framework which can be revised if appropriate, offering consistency on a variety of topics which consist of:- • Provide rules and guidelines on the commercial exploitation of IP produced within the university; • Ensure that discoveries, inventions and innovations created by staff and students are most commonly used and expected to help the public; • Set conditions for ownership; • Define the duties, rights and obligations of all stakeholders; • Develop basic guidance for the implementation of the IP policy; • Identify guidelines for revenue sharing where revenue is created by the marketing of IP. (ii) Criteria for Ownership: The IP policy of the University typically reaffirms the main principle, sets out the goals of the University with regard to the exercise of its IP rights which possess number of relevant circumstances, such as:- • Cases in which IP rights are created as a result of research funded (in whole or in part) in the context of research contracts; • Cases in which IP rights are provided as a result of funding by a public sector entity that may have particular contractual terms connected with the funding; • Cases in which the IP is created by researchers who are not bound by employment contracts, such as undergraduate or postgraduate students; • Cases in which technologies have been created in collaboration with third parties (individuals, businesses or University). (iii)When University facilities / funds are used extensively or where IPR is established jointly as part of Inventors and University, it may jointly license the product / IPR to any commercial entity, with inventors having the primary say. However, the curriculum / academic operation, IPR shall be held equally by the inventors and the University. License fees may be either / or a mixture of - 1. Upfront fees or one-time technology transfer fees 2. Royalty as a percentage of sale-price 3. Shares in the company licensing the product (iv) Further the University will not be permitted to keep the equity in compliance with the new law meaning that the (Special Purpose Vehicle) SPV such as incubator or any other registered facility must be allowed to retain the equity/ requested to keep equities on their behalf. (iv)If one or more of the inventors wish to incubate a company and license the product to this company, the royalties would be no more than 4% of sale price, preferably 1 to 2%, unless it is pure software product. If it is shares in the company, shares will again be 1% to 4%. For a pure software product licensing, there may be a revenue sharing to be mutually decided between the institute and the incubated company. (v) On the other hand, when the product / IPR is created by innovators who do not use any University facilities , outside of working hours (for employees and faculty) or not as part of a student's education, the product / IPR would be wholly owned by inventors in relation to the sacrifices made by them. In this situation, inventors may decide to license the technology to third parties or use the technology as they see fit. Item no. 21.27; Annexure-24

-- Page 12 --
(vi) If there is a conflict of ownership, a minimum of five member committees composed of two faculty members (who have established appropriate IPR and converted into commercialization), two alumni / industry experts (who have expertise in technology commercialization) and one legal consultant with expertise in IPR will investigate the matter after consulting the inventors and help them to address the conflict let’s hope everyone's happiness. The University can use the alumni / faculty of other University s as members if they cannot find a sufficiently qualified alumni / faculty of their own. (vii) The IPR cell or incubation centre can only be a coordinator and facilitator for the provision of resources to professors, employees and students. They would have no input as to how the invention is carried out, if it is patented or if it is to be authorized. If the University wants to pay for patent litigation, they will have a commission to investigate whether the IPR wants worth patenting. The committee should be made up of faculty with experience and excellence in technology translation. If inventors use their own funds or non-University funds, they alone should have a say in patenting. (viii) All decision-making bodies for incubation / IPR / technology sensing will be made up of faculty and experts who have excelled in the field of technology translation. Other faculties in the department / University will have no say, including heads of departments, heads of University s, deans or registrars. (ix) University should promote interdisciplinary research and publication on start-ups and entrepreneurship. (x) Revenue share arrangement is a core feature of IP laws. Revenue sharing offers a significant opportunity for researchers to ensure that their innovations are made accessible to the public body and to explore the best possible means of commercialization. In addition, the revenue share regulations specifically describe what form of profits is to be paid and usually refer not only to royalties but to any other lumped or bonus pay-out provided to the technology marketing organization. In this regard the revenue raised must first cover any expenditure relating to the security and use of the IP and the net income is subsequently distributed between the researcher(s), the department, the university, the Technology Transition Unit, the Support Organization and/or other partners in the figures set out in the legislation. IP regulations also set sales limits and the amount earned by the researcher declines as gross net profits rise. University IP regulations can also determine how decisions are to be made on how to distribute profits where more than one researcher is involved. That collaborative or sponsored research involving a University and a private company is common in Universities. Private companies fund research undertaken within the university by university researchers using university equipment. In such cases, it is important to have clear rules on IP ownership as well as guidelines on whether an industrial partner is entitled to an exclusive or non-exclusive patent, whether it would have to pay royalty to use the invention that benefits from such research, and whether it would have the right to sell or sublicense to third parties. Item no. 21.27; Annexure-24

-- Page 13 --
(xi) Responsibility for IP control: IP policies usually specify which body of the university may be responsible for the security and maintenance of the IP rights of the university. In certain instances, this responsibility is delegated to the technology transfer office (see section III for more detail on technology transfer offices). Responsibility to review reports of inventions and decisions on whether to license or not are usually also carried out in the IP rules. (xii) Obligations of the University and the writers: Internal University IP policies can set out such responsibilities for researchers as well as for the University itself. This can also be covered by university job arrangements with researchers. The inventor’s responsibilities which require, for example: • The requirement to report certain details to the relevant person specified in the agreement, study findings that may be covered by IP rights; • Not to reveal the technology to third parties in such a manner as to undermine its patentability; • To abide by all agreements reached with foreign parties; • To aid in the security and control of IP; and • The declaration of certain conflicts of interest. Obligations of the university (or its related bodies) can include, for example, I. Reviewing all disclosures; II. Mitigating delays; III. Retaining secrecy of inventions; IV. Promoting transfers to the good of the public; and V. To transfer rights to an author, research support organization or government if it chooses not to issue a patent or license. (5) Organizational Capacity, Human Resources and Incentives (i)To foster I& E culture, each school should recruit people that have a strong innovation and entrepreneurial/ industrial experience, behavior and attitude. Such people shall be given the responsibility of coordinating the activities innovation and pre-incubation facilities within the school and at the university level. a) Some of the relevant faculty members with prior exposure and interest should be deputed for training of the students to promote I&E. b) Faculty with exposure to startup ecosystem and experience in incubation management should be deputed to pre-incubation and incubation facilities. c) To achieve better engagement of staff in entrepreneurial activities, institutional policy on career development of staff should be developed with constant up skilling. (ii)Faculty and departments of the University have to work in coherence and cross- departmental linkages should be strengthened through shared faculty, cross-faculty Item no. 21.27; Annexure-24

-- Page 14 --
teaching and research in order to gain maximum utilization of internal resources and knowledge. (iii) Periodically some external subject matter experts such as guest lecturers or alumni can be engaged for strategic advice and bringing in skills which are not available internally. Such activities should be mentioned in the event calendar of the schools. (iv) Faculty and staff should be encouraged to do courses on innovation, entrepreneurship management and venture development. Collaboration with incubation centres of IIMs, IITs and other reputed organizations should be established. Faculty undergoing such training and courses should be actively engaged with pre-incubation and incubation facilities. (v) In order to attract and retain right people, HR policies shall include academic and non- academic incentives and reward mechanisms for all staff and stakeholders that actively contribute and support entrepreneurship agenda and activities. a) The reward system for the staff may include office and lab space for entrepreneurial activities, reduced teaching loads, awards, trainings, etc. b) The recognition of the stakeholders may include offering use of facilities and services, strategy for shared risk, as guest teachers, fellowships, associateship, etc. c) Aperformance matrix should be developed and used for evaluation of annual performance. (6) Creating Innovation Pipeline and Pathways for Entrepreneurs at Institute Level i. To ensure exposure of maximum students to innovation and pre incubation activities at their early stage of program of study and to support the pathway from ideation to innovation to market, mechanisms should be devised at University level. The innovation facilities in various schools and pre-incubation and incubation facilities at the University level should, together, build a roadmap to support entrepreneurs. The initiatives should be focused on the following: a. Spreading awareness among students, faculty and staff about the value of entrepreneurship and its role in career development or employability. b. Students/ staff should be taught that innovation (technology, process or business innovation) is a mechanism to solve the problems of the society and consumers. Entrepreneurs should innovate with focus on the market niche. c. Students should be encouraged to develop entrepreneurial mindset through experiential learning by exposing them to training in cognitive skills (e.g. design thinking, critical thinking, etc.), by inviting first generation local entrepreneurs or experts to address young minds. Initiatives like idea and innovation competitions, hackathons, workshops, bootcamps, seminars, conferences, exhibitions, mentoring by academic and industry personnel, throwing real life challenges, awards and recognition should be routinely organized by the innovation, pre-incubation and incubation facilities. d. Prepare the students for creating the start up through the education. Integration of education activities with enterprise-related activities should be done. Item no. 21.27; Annexure-24
