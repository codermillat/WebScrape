It was my immense luck and fortune to be part of Sharda University where I can grow. The Architecture department faculty leaves no stone unturned to shape one's future. My five years at Sharda have been a wonderful experience of learning with prolific exposure to outside. Huge respect, love and devotion for entire faculty members for organizing workshops for our development. It's their efforts that make me to count myself into better professionals.
My five years at Sharda were great and a memory to cherish for lifetime. It was full of learning and grooming oneself. It gave me an opportunity to meet different kind of people and learned many things. I am thankful to all the faculties, mentors and entire department Overall it was a great experience and lifetime memory at Sharda.
Architecture is a field with uniqueness and individuality, the passion for which comes within the individual. The exposure that Sharda University provides is too good for a person who wants to achieve something. The faculty is always available and willing to help. My peers help me out in every way. Here the potentials are harnessed, skills are developed, confidence is built and dreams are realized.
I would like to have this opportunity to introduce myself as a practicing Architect from India whose world revolves around exploring Art and Architecture around the world. I am Pragya and I have completed my graduation from Sharda University. It was my first steps towards my carrier and I have no doubt now that I had taken the right decision. Those 5yrs in Sharda have been great and worth it. It not only helped me to develop my design development skills but also helped me to understand the foundation of Architecture. Hence I got my masters degree from Sydney, Australia and therefore started my own firm in the name Upscale. Its been a great journey, Thank you Sharda.
I decided to pursue Architecture in the very beginning of my school life. Joining Sharda was like a dream come true to me, as I was never exposed to that kind of culture before. Sharda will be always on the top from where I ‘ve not only learned Architecture but also come across the nicest of the friends and tutors. The ones who have had a college life always wish to turn back time to live it all once again.
I can proudly say that Ive cashed maximum of learnings from Sharda and enjoyed as well in the same time to balance out the life. And it makes me feel happy when I see our juniors doing better than us & the work eminence is developing day-by-day. Good job done by the faculty and the students as well.
Great place to have a much-required practical exposure, something that's essential for Architecture! Good infrastructure and requisite instruments to use, under the guidance of fine faculties.
The learning course of 1825 days, in which 365 days kept aside for Internship. The rest of the 1460 days tentatively at School of planning and Architecture at Sharda university campus was filled with learning, opportunities and of course a hand full of guidance from the renowned faculties, sharing their experiences. It was a blissful state when SPA decided to combine the B. Design , BJMC and B. ARCH together on our foundation year to enhance/get a larger broader way of thinking with multiple aspects on different fields with different perspective. We got the opportunity to think the design in product, textile, building materials, colour & texture, form & space where all together meet the concepts for projects. Several aspects of Animation, Sound and Photography too added on to our technical skills. Now working in my professional career as an Architect and an Architectural photographer, am proud to be a graduate from Sharda University.
I started my journey in Architecture by joining the 5 Year B.Arch. program from Sharda University in the year 2012. We were just the second batch of Architecture students & so nothing much that we could count on but the excitement of unknown territory.
The foundation year of the program was something I had never expected. We had workshops, studios ranging from engineering drawings to writing. The system was both robust & flexible at the same time. This unique foundation course aligned us to the world & approach of design. It didnt teach us what to think but taught us how to think. The faculty has been supportive of all endeavours & supported in every way possible. The top notch labs, libraries & the diverse crowd of folks, which Sharda is a pioneer of, gave me taste of emerging opportunities.
In my academic journey of under graduation, I have had the opportunity to work for Design studios that ranged from a library design to Urban design. The various workshops at regional & national levels have helped me gain a wide understanding of materials, construction techniques. My experience from Sharda has enriched me with local craftsmanship. This has further helped me be being sensitive to design. The initiative to have my own venture is a culmination of an enriching life experience which is Sharda University truly -beyond boundaries – both literal & metaphorical.
It was great experience studying at Sharda University and lifetime memory. Being at a global institution allows me to interact with a variety of international students. The Sharda University mentors assisted us in improving our academic and social abilities. I also miss my university , my faculty members and my friends.

At Sharda University, I learnt that, design is not only the most integral foundation of a product but also an essential that gives a unique identity to it, and at the same time provides an easy functionality for everyone to comprehend and use. This is the definition of design which I learnt, experienced and incorporated in my personal and professional life. In the 4 years of my graduation at Department of Design at Sharda University I learnt about the smallest details and biggest facts about designing and myself. I still remember in my foundation year where I felt that I am still in a junior class and my teachers are helping me to understand what is design by distinct mediums, the environment was ever widening. By my final year of graduation, I was accomplishing my thesis and designing a product of very my own. The thing I appreciate the most about the design department at the Sharda University is that, apart from our chosen design stream, we get to work and interact with faculties, intellectuals and other students; as a result, we also learn about other designing fields. The workshops and events also help us learn about the design practicality and possibilities. In conclusion, I can proudly say that i am Graduate designer from Sharda University.

As a student of Interior Design, I Utkarsh Gupta, have been exposed to an uplifting experience of being part of Sharda University's Department of Design. In here, I found qualified mentors, who advice and mentor me, guide me into the right path to help me achieve my dreams and goals as an Interior Designer. Extracurriculars like site visits, competitions and client interactions help me grow into my future role as an interior designer. Apart from academics Sharda encourages growth. The university campus with its diversity and amenities truly feels like "home". Design is a state of mind it's developed over time, it is an expression of yourself and of the place, Sharda has helped me recognize and express those feelings. Sharda has nurtured the potential within me to make me the Designer I am.

I believe that design as a field is and always will be something very personal, the passion for which comes from within an individual. One just needs to strive hard to harvest this passion and I am proud to say that Department of Design, Sharda University, was able to help find me this treasure in myself. The guidance and support I received from my mentors were beyond comparison. They have always strived in bringing out the passion for design out of every student, who simultaneously had the willingness to travel on the path of self-discovery. The learning experience in Sharda University not only involved academics and practical studio sessions, but also off campus activities like industrial visits and day excursions, which helped in gaining a lot of exposure. Moreover, having studied in a diversity provided a lot of exposure in understanding various cultures which in the long run, is beneficial in the field of design.

I, Bellinda Franque, a student of Interior Design 3yr, have been exposed to a heart-warming experience of being part of Sharda University's Department of Design. In here, I found qualified mentors, who guide and coach me, the right equipment to help me achieve my dreams and goals as an Interior Designer. I am exposed to a world outside through site visits, competitions and direct contact with clients, all of which are essential for helping me build my career. Besides academic values, Sharda University possesses cultural and moral values, as I am able to indulge with the diversity present here, its environment truly gives a feeling of "home". Design is not only based on a place or idea, but also, on a feeling. Something which I am proud to say that I developed here, in Sharda University, because it helped me to explore the potential that I have within me.
B. Design (Interior Design), 2017-18
One of the best times that Ive had, from every single perspective – academics, teachers, wonderful ambiance to learn, friends – the entire experience. The professors are dedicated and co-operative. The amount of support that is offered is unlimited and incomparable. Sharda University played a big role in not just helping me become the successful graduate but also by providing an opportunity to kick start my career by being part of design & development team of Sharda Uzbekistan Refurbishment design project. Time flew by, but the memories and lessons learnt will be treasured for a lifetime.
Three years have passed surprisingly quickly, yet it was memorable at each step of the way. I feel immensely privileged to be part of Sharda University. To be able to undertake a degree that I feel genuinely passionate about has been a rewarding experience. The learning method was challenging at the beginning as we are international students but as the program evolved, I have developed skills to allow me to focus better on what I need to learn. Living in India and discovering the Indian culture by travelling around the country and befriending Indian classmates is truly stimulating. Being able to get constant encouragement and support from the Professors in academic activities as well as outside the campus was an incredible privilege for which I will always remain grateful. It has opened doors that I didnt know it was going to open.
