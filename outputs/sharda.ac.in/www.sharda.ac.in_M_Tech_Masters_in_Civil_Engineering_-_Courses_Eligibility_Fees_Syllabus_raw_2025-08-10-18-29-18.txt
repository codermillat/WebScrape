M.Tech in Civil Engineering with specialization in Structural Engineering
SET0310
2 Years
• Course Fee
M.Tech. in Civil Engineering with specialization in Structural Engineering is a two-year postgraduate programme that involves the analysis and design of steel and concrete structures and analysis of structures for dynamic forces and study of advanced materials. It requires knowledge and competence in the areas of materials, response of individual structural components, and the behavior of entire structural systems. This programme trains individuals in advanced concepts of structural engineering by in-depth coursework, hands-on modeling projects and dissertation work. Students undergo coursework during the first year on various aspects of structural engineering and apply these constructs to a major research project during the second year. Students are imparted advanced learning in Analysis and Design of Structures, Structural Dynamics and Earthquake Resistant Design of Structures, Repair and Rehabilitation of Structures and Advanced Materials. The students are exposed to practical learning by working on real-world projects in the Structure Design lab integrated with latest design software and construction material lab. The practical lab sessions require students to apply theoretical knowledge to realize their value through implementation. The objective of the program is to produce structural engineers who integrate and build on the Program's core curricular concepts in the pursuit of professional leadership, teamwork, life-long learning, and career advancement.
