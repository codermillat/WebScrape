M.Sc. in Mathematics is a two-year post-graduate programme designed to extend students knowledge and refine their abilities to solve complex problems accurately.
The programme comprises classical Mathematics courses as well as skilful training in modern computing facilities in both symbolic and numerical computations. M.Sc. Mathematics introduces students to a wide choice of modules in interesting areas such as coding theory fractal geometry and analytic theory operation research graph theory number theory etc. This programme also gives an opportunity for students to conduct independent researches in pure to applied mathematics computing cryptography etc.
Besides the programme focuses on propelling students numeracy skills and the ability to use mathematical concepts to the model the solution to financial mathematical problems. The programme also enables the students to develop the ability to consolidate and communicate mathematics logically and briefly in a variety of forms. Students who want to pursue higher education in the field of Mathematics can opt for PhD in the same discipline.
*M.Sc. (CW) - M.Sc. with Course Work
*M.Sc. (RW) - M.Sc. with Research Work
*M.Sc. (CW + RW) - M.Sc. with Course Work & Research Work
