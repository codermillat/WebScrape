B.Sc. Radiological Imaging Techniques (Radiology/CT/MRI)
SAH0107
3.5 Years
• Course Fee
B.Sc. Radiological Imaging Techniques (Radiology/CT/MRI) is a 3.5 years undergraduate programme meticulously structured to impart in-depth advance knowledge of Imaging methodologies and principles. The curriculum has been designed to meet the growing needs of professionals in the field of clinical radiography, radiation safety, image processing technology, imaging modalities, etc.
The programme prepares students to work collaboratively, evaluate data, interpret results, think vitally, draw logical conclusions and make composite decisions. The curriculum of the programme gives students the opportunities to devise plausible solutions to real-life situations in an active healthcare environment.
The programme broadly emphasizes the following key areas Human Anatomy, Human Physiology, Radiation Physics, Pathology, Radio Diagnosis, Medical Microbiology, Medical Biochemistry, Specialised Diagnostic Techniques, Radiological Technology, and Radiotherapy
Programme Educational Objectives (PEO)
• PEO1: Disciplinary knowledge and its appropriate application: This subject will facilitate students to gain relevant disciplinary understanding of the nature, practice and application of Medical Imaging Technology through lectures, Hans on training on imaging machines, computer practical, workshops and presentations. The material will be assessed in the test and the examination
• PEO2: Professional skills and their appropriate application Provide Time management, personal organization and teamwork skills, and communication skills will be developed through the presentation projects.
• PEO3: Engagement with the needs of society The subject will enhance the capacity of the students to respond to the needs and grapple with ethical concerns that accompany the practice of Medical Imaging (e.g. the balance between diagnostic accuracy and radiation dose to the patient, the staff and population as a whole).
• PEO4: Clinical Care Using a patient/family-centered approach and best evidence, each student will organize and implement the prescribed preventive, investigative and management plans and will offer appropriate follow-up services.
• PEO5: Lifelong learning The student should be committed to continuous improvement in skills and knowledge while harnessing modern tools and technology. Program objectives will aim at making the students being able to: Perform objective self-assessments of their knowledge and skills learn and refine existing skills and acquire new skills
• PEO6: Social Accountability and Responsibility The students will recognize that allied and healthcare professionals need to be advocates within the health care system, to judiciously manage resources and to acknowledge their social accountability. They have a mandate to serve the community, region and the nation and will hence direct all research and service activities towards addressing their priority health concerns.
• PO1: Apply the knowledge of clinical, diagnostic and Medical physics, Imaging technology, clinical sciences, as well as an understanding of health care delivery diagnostic imaging system.
• PO2: Find, analyze, evaluate and apply the information systematically and shall make a appropriate diagnosis to provide quality of image along with patient care.
• PO3: Demonstrate effective planning abilities including the prevention, detection, radiation protection, diagnosis, and management of patient without compromising image quality.
• PO4: Apply ethical principles like radiation protection and commit to professional ethics and responsibilities and norms of the Imaging techniques practice.
• PO5: Conduct and present research and clinical studies which will contribute to the advancement of Imaging techniques, quality, diagnosis and health sciences.
• PO6: Explain theory of technology, instrumentation and physics in Medical Imaging using discipline specific terminology.
This course is for individuals who...
Are compassionate, adaptable and display great attention to detail. It is for aspirants who have a civic sense of duty and seek satisfaction in improving patients lives are an ideal fit for this course
Students who are looking for...
