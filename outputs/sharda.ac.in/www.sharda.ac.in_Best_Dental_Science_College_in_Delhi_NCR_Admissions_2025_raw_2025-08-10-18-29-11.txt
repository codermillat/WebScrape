I was always told in my childhood that college days are the best days. When I joined School of Dental Sciences, Sharda University for my undergraduate programme, I realised how true the saying was. Living in a campus with such diverse culture and so many different extra curriculum activities, you learn so much about life and that helps you grow and become wise as a person. Joining Sharda University has been the best decision for my career prospects and has indeed been the best experience of my life.
Sharda University is a great home -away-from- home anyone could ever have. What a great atmosphere- what a great bunch of students- what an institute what an incredible staff! I am glad, I am part of this truly global university
BDS, 4th Year
Sharda University is a wonderful institution. There are people from different cultures here, and that interests me. I like the campus life a lot!
BDS, 3rd Year
I am a proud Shardan who had an enriching learning experience during both my undergraduate and post graduate time. The faculties here are experts in their field and were able to extract the best out of me. I have been able to reinvent myself into a more confident individual and able to broaden my horizons. I can proudly say that Sharda University has made me a better person individually as well as professionally. I am blessed to be a part of Sharda family.
MDS, 3rd Year
“From the journey of nothing to everything!
Sharda University has been a turning point to my career. The growth and opportunities that I received from the University are great, I never had a confidence to crack highest placements packages but the University had that confidence in me. The faculty, the placement team works really hard on students to build up their career. I'm grateful and will always be grateful to the University for being such an important support system.”
