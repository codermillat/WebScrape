B. Tech. in Food Technology programme is a four-year undergraduate programme that introduces students to food-related technologies and its various specifications. It includes the study of the nutritive values of food and their chemical composition and relates to the study of areas food production areas like packaging, chemical balances of food, nutrition, microbiology etc. along with the foundational knowledge of food products and food raw materials.
Students are introduced to various techniques such as food marketing, food processing, food and its related research methods etc. which helps them to understand them in the raw form and cope up with the challenges in the food processing industry.
The curriculum is designed to impart engineering knowledge in topics such as Unit Operations, Food Preservation, Crop Processing, Food Packaging and Food Safety & Quality Management to the students.
Program Educational Objectives (PEO)
• PEO1:Graduates will be able to integrate the physical, biological and mathematical sciences with engineering principles for the study of food systems and human well being.
• PEO2:Graduates will demonstrate the applications of food processing and food engineering principles through development of appropriate equipment, processes and entrepreneurship that are of societal and industrial importance.
• PEO3:Graduates will adapt to and update with rapidly changing food processing ecosystem through self-improvement with continuous learning about the impact of technology and engineering solutions on the sustainability of human nutrition and environment.
• PEO4:Graduates will develop communication skills and demonstrate independent thinking, analytical and problem solving skills, self-management and function effectively in team-oriented and open-ended activities in an industrial or academic environment.
• PEO5:Graduates will develop leadership skills at levels appropriate to their experience and perform ethically and professionally in business, academia, industry and society.
• PO1: Engineering knowledge: Apply the knowledge of mathematics, science, engineering fundamentals, and an engineering specialization to the solution of complex engineering problems.
• PO2: Problem analysis: Identify, formulate, review research literature, and analyze complex engineering problems reaching substantiated conclusions using first principles of mathematics, natural sciences, and engineering sciences.
• PO3: Design/development of solutions: Design solutions for complex engineering problems and design system components or processes that meet the specified needs with appropriate consideration for the public health and safety, and the cultural, societal, and environmental considerations.
• PO4: Conduct investigations of complex problems: Use research-based knowledge and research methods including design of experiments, analysis and interpretation of data, and synthesis of the information to provide valid conclusions.
• PO5: Modern tool usage: Create, select, and apply appropriate techniques, resources, and modern engineering and IT tools including prediction and modelling to complex engineering activities with an understanding of the limitations.
• PO6: The engineer and society: Apply reasoning informed by the contextual knowledge to assess societal, health, safety, legal and cultural issues and the consequent responsibilities relevant to the professional engineering practice.
• PO7: Environment and sustainability: Understand the impact of the professional engineering solutions in societal and environmental contexts, and demonstrate the knowledge of, and need for sustainable development.
• PO8: Ethics: Apply ethical principles and commit to professional ethics and responsibilities and norms of the engineering practice.
• PO9: Individual and team work: Function effectively as an individual, and as a member or leader in diverse teams, and in multidisciplinary settings.
