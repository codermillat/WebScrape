B. Tech in Electronics and Communication is a four-year undergraduate programme focused on utilising science and applied mathematics to solve practical problems in the field of communications. The Programme is Accredited by the National Board of Accreditation(NBA). Broadly, the programme intends to inculcate an in-depth understanding of signals, circuits and how to use differential equations techniques for developing excellent Electronics and Communication products and devices.
The programme commences with acquainting the students to the principles of Electronics Engineering, Digital Signal Processing, Computer Networks, Analog Electronics and Network Theory. Progressively the programme deals with subjects like Digital Communication Computer Architecture and Technical Skill Enhancement.
In addition, the programme also focuses on improving the skill set of students through industrial visits and practical sessions. A good number of weeks are dedicated training slots incorporated within the curriculum for the same. Students interested in learning more about Electronics and Communication can further pursue higher education.
