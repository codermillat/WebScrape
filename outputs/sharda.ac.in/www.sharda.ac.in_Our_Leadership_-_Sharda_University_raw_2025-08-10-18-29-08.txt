“Inspired by the timeless principles of Jainism, we are committed to shaping compassionate, ethical, and globally-minded leaders ready to make a meaningful impact on the world.”
A leading educational reformer who has given a new direction to the teaching methodology practiced across the country, Mr. Pradeep Kumar Gupta is the Chairman of Sharda Group of Institutions. Sharda University is set to achieve new heights in the education world with its global outlook and international faculty. Bringing his dream into reality, in 1995, he established the Sharda Education Trust under which he opened up an engineering college in 1996 in Agra, well known as Hindustan Institute of Science & Technology. In 1997, he opened up a second college for students of management and computer science by the name of Hindustan Institute of Management & Computer Studies.
Having been involved in the education industry, he delved deep to understand the lack-lustre output of the industry. This unveiled many facts, like the fact that the examination system only tested the memory rather than testing the intelligence of the students and the fact that teachers only incorporated theoretical knowledge in the classrooms and were exposed to the practical knowledge prevailing outside in the market. Hence, an education system which would inculcate an application based approach in the young students, envigored the thought of opening up educational institutions which would focus more on nurturing the talent and developing curiosity in young individuals, in his mind. Looking at the huge response and demand for colleges, he opened up Anand Engineering College in 1998 and Babu Mohanlal Arya Smarak (BMAS) Engineering College in 1999. He also realized that the custom of not providing higher education to a girl child was still prevailing. As a result of his devotion towards his mother Sharda Gupta, he decided to grant 90% scholarship to girls whose families could not afford to pay their tuition fee. With this step, 70% of admissions were given to girls in 1999. Since then, he made it a point to give out donations and charity only for the education of girls.
