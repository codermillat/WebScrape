Government of India, Under National Education Policy-2020, intends to enable students across the nation with the “Academic Bank of Credits” (ABC) system for fulfilling their thirst for knowledge by providing academic flexibility to pick and modify their educational paths, link diverse disciplines, and; assist them in acquiring the proper foundations and building blocks for their ambitions. The “Academic Bank of Credits” (ABC) is an educational digital platform created to facilitate students’ seamless mobility between or within degree-granting Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) through a formal system of credit recognition, credit accumulation, credit transfers, and credit redemption in order to promote distributed and flexible teaching and learning. The ABC platform will provide students (having a DigiLocker account) with the opportunity to register for a unique ABC ID, an interactive dashboard to see their credit accumulation, and options to begin a choice-based credit transfer mechanism.
