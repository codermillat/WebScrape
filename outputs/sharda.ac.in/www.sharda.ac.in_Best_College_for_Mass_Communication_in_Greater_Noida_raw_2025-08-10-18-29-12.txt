Innovations When I look behind, I see the best days which one could spent in their college life. I enjoyed each and every moment spent in Sharda University. I had spent three long years in that University, where I learnt how to grow and grow. I did my Bachelors of Journalism and Mass Communication from Sharda University. Whenever I look behind, I cherish each moment which I had lived there. A girl who has just passed her 12th standard does not know much that what is good for her career, but here in Sharda University I always got motivated from my teachers. They always supported me in my projects. They were always standing behind me in my toughest phase of life where I didn't know what to do in my career. Professors always treated us like their own family

Choosing Journalism and Mass Communication course at Sharda University is the best choice I have made till date. The course structure and learning pattern teaches us a lot. The faculty of the department gave us both theoretical and practical knowledge of the media eld. The support and encouragement helped me to cross all the obstacles. With their support, efforts and teaching knowledge, I got the opportunity to work with the best media houses like Hindustan Times and Hindu newspaper which gave a kick start to my career as a journalist and writer. And, now I am working as an Associate Editor with a web health portal 'Mynahcare.com'. I always embrace my whole journey with the university and faculty. I will definitely recommend everyone to be a part of this.

The delicate years of my school life dashed off learning thoughts like 'an aimless person is like a rudderless boat tossing in an ocean.' Alas! it was not until I joined Sharda University, I realised it is only a rudderless boat that has the liberty to oat resolutely at will. Only a rudderless boat can dance to the blithe breeze, play with the maddening waves - all thanks to this glorious institution called Sharda University – it's value based education, practical oriented curriculum, most engaging classroom modules, faculty of astounding wisdom and the university's erudite ambience that never ceases to enchant. Graduating with a bachelors degree in journalism and mass communication and thereafter a brief stint in news reporting, I eventually went on to complete my post gradation in International Journalism from University of Sussex, United Kingdom on a scholarship. Currently, I am working for the international desk of a global news channel in China. Sharda University helped me gain enough of every gratifying experience to keep me smiling for another thousand lifetimes.

This course has helped me experience and explore many new things which is related to the course. The department got a small number of students and this gave us the opportunity to have more and close interaction with the staffs and faculties. I enjoyed my time at Sharda also I got to meet varieties of label mates from different countries and states.

I believe that design as a field is and always will be something very personal, the passion for which comes from within the deepest parts of an individual. One just needs to strive hard to harvest this passion from under the ocean and I am glad to say that the School of Art, Design and Media Studies, Sharda University, was able to help find me this treasure in myself. I would say, the guidance and support I received from my mentors was beyond comparison as, they have always strived in bringing out the passion for design out of every student, who simultaneously had the willingness to travel on the path of self-discovery. The learning experience in Sharda University not only involved academics and practical studio sessions, but also off campus activities like industrial visits and day excursions, which helped in gaining a lot of exposure. Moreover, having studied in a diversified University, where the fellow classmates hailed from various parts of this world, provided a lot of exposure in understanding various cultures, which I believe, in a long run would be beneficial in the field of design

Sharda University Department of Design gave me the tools to go out in the world with confidence.The concepts I learned are priceless. Being a designer, inspiration can be hard to come by and at sharda school of design i was taught from the very beginning how to use the resources we had, to create top level designs-even on a small budget. The Sharda University staff are second to none! I challenge any college to find professors who care as much about their student as the ones at Sharda. I interned at Cengres TIles and attended gallery walks and shows while at Sharda University

I like the fact that the no. of students in the classes are not many and the faculties are amazingly friendly, interactive and also very helpful in and outside campus. They are always available and willing to help. They also guide us well and very supportive. The environment there is very sociable with different people from different countries. And yeah the food specially from uncle's cafe and the Lego house was really good. A great place for students..

I absolutely loved this course. It showed me aspects of Interior Design that I didn't consider before and the fact that it covers history as well as architecture in college assignments, it helped me develop my eye for various styles and their decor as they relate to specific areas. It is a great way to start analyzing and criticizing the interior as well as exterior treatments of various buildings. During my training, I learned many new things, received encouragement to explore my creativity and style as well as improve and obtain more skill in the areas that were my weaker points.
This course was definitely worth taking. I plan to explore and expand my creativity using the knowledge and skill acquired from the course in my future career as an Interior Designer.
