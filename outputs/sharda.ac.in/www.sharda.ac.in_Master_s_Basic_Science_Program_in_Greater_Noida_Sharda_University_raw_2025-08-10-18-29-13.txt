The post-graduate basic science programmes at Sharda University focus on creating a pool of intellectual thinkers and prominent leaders in the area of science and technology. These programmes include full-time study schedules encouraging the students to advance beyond the simple learning of scientific facts. The design of the curriculum fosters exposure to many of the basic-science subjects equipping students with advanced reasoning and problem-solving skills. Students will receive education by experienced educators and researchers who are leaders in their field, both nationally and internationally.
In addition, given the competition for this field, the admissions for these programmes have limited seats which allow faculty advisors to work closely with the students to ensure they meet the degree requirements. These programmes further provide students with comprehensive guidance concerning their applications to doctoral programmes as well.
