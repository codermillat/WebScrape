B. Tech in Electronics and Computer Engineering is a four-year undergraduate programme focused on utilising science and applied computing to solve practical problems in the field of computer and electronics. Broadly, the programme intends to inculcate an in-depth understanding of coding, circuits and how to use differential equations techniques for developing excellent Electronics and Computer products and software.
The programme commences with acquainting the students to the principles of Electronics Engineering, High level computer languages like C++, JAVA, Python, Principles of Sensors and Data Acquisition, Transducers and Signal Conditioning, Computer Networks, Computer Organization, Machine Learning, Database Management Systems, Cloud Computing, Analog Electronics and Network Theory, Introduction to Internet of Things, IoT System Architecture. Progressively the programme deals with subjects like Digital Electronics, Computer Architecture and Technical Skill Enhancement.
In addition, the programme also focuses on improving the skill set of students through industrial visits and practical sessions. A good number of weeks are dedicated training slots incorporated within the curriculum for the same. Students interested in learning more about Electronics and Computer can further pursue higher education.
