‘Sharda (School of law) – anything I would voice about it will play only a very small part to define its brilliance& excellence. Academic experience to a world class infrastructure and admirable faculty has privileged me a lifelong career excellence. School of Law brought unique programmes and teaching methodologies, which were all backed by practical skills through Moot Courts, Research Practices, Free Legal Aid Programmes, Constitutional Bench Competitions, Field visits to legal & enforcement organizations. Let me also throw light as how individuality was polished by Legal seminars & workshops exposing the students to the eminent personalities both national & international. The school has brought to our doorsteps, ample opportunities by representing its students, faculties and research advocates in internships, placements, conferences & assemblies worldwide. Every sphere of it, be it the academic or administrative department, one can find support & guidance throughout.
I feel immensely blessed for my 5 years as a student in B.A-LLB. I shall be ever grateful to my university for thevalues it has infused in me,both professional &personal. Trust me, this is the best that life can offer you at an early age!!
Keeping what my professors have enriched in me, I would like to share the quote I have adhered in myself –
“Reach to your fullest potential, give your 100% of hard work, focus & perseverance to any role you are chosen for, success will follow. Keep striving!!”

Moving from International Baccalaureate was a daunting prospect but when I walked through Front Arch on Freshers' Week I was immediately put at ease. There were hundreds of students in white colored shirts around promoting an array of different societies and clubs. I'm an active member of a few societies and currently in second year participating in various moot courts and quizzes. These are all great ways to get involved and make friends.
The Sharda Law School is quite accessible. The lecturers are always supportive and the tutor system is really effective. Students in other years are always happy to lend advice (and notes if you're lucky!). Sharda offers several internship accessibilities as well allowing students to perceive practical experiences in their specified field. I'm hoping to become a solicitor working in medical malpractice soon.
