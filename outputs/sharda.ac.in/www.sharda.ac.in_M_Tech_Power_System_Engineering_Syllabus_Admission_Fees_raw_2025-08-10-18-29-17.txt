SET0407
2 Years
• Course Fee
M. Tech (Electrical & Electronics Engineering) Power System Engineering is a two-year post-graduate programme that introduces aspirants with processes of monitoring, developing, designing and evaluating high-end power systems for managing a variety of challenging projects and research work. The coursework of the programme includes economic, sustainable, efficient and reliable energy generation. In addition, it also focuses on concepts like conversion, transmission, distribution, storage and utilisation of electric energy.
Under this programme, aspirants also gain skills to manage projects within cost and time constrained environments. The state-of-the-art laboratories facilitate students to apply and implement concepts learned during theory sessions. In most of the subjects, there will be theory and practical classes.
Program Educational Objectives (PEOs)
• PEO1: The Graduates will establish themselves with knowledge and technical skill to match the need of modern industries of power sector and automation.
• PEO2 : Graduates will be motivated for research and higher education and support their entrepreneurial learning.
• PEO3 : Graduates will demonstrate their communication skills and critical reasoning skills to perform responsibilities ethically for the sustainable development of the society.
• PEO4: The Graduates will be able to learn and adopt new technologies in a multi- and interdisciplinary work environment for innovative solutions for real world problems
The Program Objectives (POs) :
• PO1: Engineering knowledge: Apply the knowledge of mathematics, science, engineering fundamentals, and an engineering specialization to the solution of complex engineering problems.
• PO2: Problem analysis: Identify, formulate, review research literature, and analyze complex engineering problems reaching substantiated conclusions using first principles of mathematics, natural sciences, and engineering sciences.
• PO3: Design/development of solutions: Design solutions for complex engineering problems and design system components or processes that meet the specified needs with appropriate consideration for the public health and safety, and the cultural, societal, and environmental considerations.
• PO4: Conduct investigations of complex problems: Use research-based knowledge and research methods including design of experiments, analysis and interpretation of data, and synthesis of the information to provide valid conclusions.
• PO5: Modern tool usage: Create, select, and apply appropriate techniques, resources, and modern engineering and IT tools including prediction and modelling to complex engineering activities with an understanding of the limitations.
• PO6: The engineer and society: Apply reasoning informed by the contextual knowledge to assess societal, health, safety, legal and cultural issues and the consequent responsibilities relevant to the professional engineering practice.
• PO7: Ethics: Apply ethical principles and commit to professional ethics and responsibilities and norms of the engineering practice.
• PO8: Individual and team work: Function effectively as an individual, and as a member or leader in diverse teams, and in multidisciplinary settings.
• PO9: Project management and finance: Demonstrate knowledge and understanding of the engineering and management principles and apply these to one’s own work, as a member and leader in a team, to manage projects and in multidisciplinary environments.
• PO10: Life-long learning: Recognize the need for, and have the preparation and ability to engage in independent and life-long learning in the broadest context of technological change.
The Program Specific Objectives (PSOs)
• PSO1: To be able to critically investigate complex power system scenarios and arrive at possible solutions, by applying the acquired theoretical and practical knowledge.
• PSO2: To be able to work on well-defined projects by interpreting available power system data to provide real time solutions pertaining to power system issues.
