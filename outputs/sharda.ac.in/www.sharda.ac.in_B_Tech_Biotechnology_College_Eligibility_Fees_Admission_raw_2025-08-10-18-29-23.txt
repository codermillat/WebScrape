Department of Biotechnology started with a vision to impart in-depth knowledge of biotechnology to create a pool of scientific personnel with expertise in biological engineering. Since then the department has endeavoured to educate and train its students to develop proficiency in each sector of biotechnology. The scheme of courses has been designed keeping in the demand trend in mind. A conscious effort has been made so that curriculum of each programme integrates courses of biological sciences and engineering together with relevant laboratory programs and a compulsory research project of variable duration. The university has recognized the significant role being played by biotechnologists in industrial development and has sought to implement an integrated approach towards education and research. The department strongly believes a teacher has to be involved in active research to be in touch with the recent development in the subject so as to deliver the latest know-how. The department has a strong interdisciplinary research and teaching base in biological sciences and engineering which prepares the student for industry as well as research programs.
All the basic infrastructural facilities needed for conducting teaching and research programmes in different areas of Biotechnology have been developed in the department. The department is housed in a newly constructed building consisting of classrooms with audio-visual facilities well-equipped students laboratories research laboratories special lab for molecular biology genetic engineering plant tissue culture Microbial technology nano biotechnology and bioinformatics. the students undergo project training in modern biotechnology viz bioinformatics genomics nano biotechnology cancer cell signaling plant and animal Biotechnology structure base drug design neuro biology etc.
