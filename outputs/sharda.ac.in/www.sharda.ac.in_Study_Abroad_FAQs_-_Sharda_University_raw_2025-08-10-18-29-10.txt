Why should I study abroad?
A better question to ask is, “Why not?” There are so many great reasons to go abroad. You know the old saying, “Travel is the only thing you buy that makes you richer”? Thats exactly why you should do it. When you study abroad, you have the opportunity to learn about another culture firsthand, form global friendships, and practice a foreign language. The unique challenges you face will help you grow personally, gain a better understanding of the world, and improve your job prospects after graduation. Youll return home as a global citizen who is more independent, mature, and tolerant of cultural differences.
Am I eligible to study abroad?
Eligibility requirements vary by university and program. Typically students must be at least in their 2nd Year of studies at the time of departure. The minimum cumulative CGPA usually varies between 7.00 and 9.00 on a 10.0 scale, while more competitive programs have a higher CGPA requirement. Other qualifications include a letter of recommendation from one of your professors and nomination from your school. Consult the International Cell in your school for specifics, and plan accordingly so you can meet all of the requirements by the time you want to study abroad.
I dont know another language. Will this be a problem?
Not at all. You can study abroad if you only know English, and you won't be limited to English-speaking countries like the USA or Australia, either. While a few programs have a language prerequisite or only offer courses in the host country's language. Most study abroad programs are available in English in Asia, Europe, and North America. If you do end up in a non-English speaking county like Mexico, Germany, France, Spain, Greece, South Korea, Slovenia, or Russia, you will most likely pick up parts of the language
Is studying abroad expensive?
Studying abroad can be quite affordable. The overall cost will ultimately depend on a variety of factors including your destination of choice (cost of living), kind of university (public or private), currency exchange rates, personal expenses, accommodation/food fees charged by the Partner University, and medical insurance and international travel costs.
What funding is available ?
When should I start planning?
The sooner, the better! When you start early, youll have more time to research in depth and find a program that suits your personal and academic needs. Youll also have more time to decide what type of experience youre looking for in terms of location, immersion, duration and cost. It is best to start planning at least one year and no later than one semester before you actually want to depart. Pay attention to application deadlines and apply once youve decided on your program.
If you feel overwhelmed by your options and need help deciding where to go, feel free to contact the Study Abroad Department in International Relations. There youll find a quick overview of what its like to study abroad in a particular country, as well as reviews of programs. Once you have chosen a country, you can even read tips on narrowing down your program and read reviews.
Can I still graduate on time if I study abroad?
Absolutely! Most students who study abroad will graduate on time. It is crucial that you plan your courses carefully before departing, as well as the courses you will take abroad, so that you will not interrupt course sequences or miss out on required classes offered during specific semesters if you will be away. You should also confirm with the study abroad office that the credits you take abroad will transfer back to Sharda university.
How long can I study abroad?
Typically you can study abroad for a semester or trimester. A semester abroad usually starts in September (1st Semester) and ends in December or January, or in January or February (2nd Semester) and ends in June.
What types of accommodation are available to me?
Options vary and usually include student hostels, apartments, and residential halls (dormitories). Each presents its own level of cultural immersion and degree of independence. Depending on how your program arranges housing, you may be living with other international students or locals.
Remember to reflect on all of your housing options to determine what will be the most comfortable for you (while still being challenging and a learning experience!). If you are going to a country very different than India if you are an Home student, or your home country if you are an International student, you may consider living in campus to help balance the outside stressors. Also remember to consider the country, area, and university you are aiming to study abroad. Europe, North American, or Asia? European and North American countries will be more expensive in terms of accommodation options than going to another Asian country. Also accommodation fees may vary considerably and range from US$700 to US$ 1,400 per semester in public universities, and from US$1,800 to even US$4,500 per semester in private universities in different countries
