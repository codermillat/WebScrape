B.Sc. in Mathematics is a three-year undergraduate programme that helps students to develop interpretive analytical and logical skills required to endeavour in the field of Mathematics. The programme trains students to handle concrete & abstract problems and solve them using their critical observations.
The coursework of the programme includes algebra trigonometry calculus vector calculus graph theory differential geometry complex analysis real analysis and differential equations. Students are also given hands-on training in practical sessions which enables them to learn the mathematical principles in depth.
Apart from Mathematics students will also become accustomed to Physics Chemistry Computers and English which will prepare them to excel in every field and industry. The curriculum is structured in a manner that it improves students software computing mathematical experimental conceptual and communication skills for advanced professional academic and research careers.
