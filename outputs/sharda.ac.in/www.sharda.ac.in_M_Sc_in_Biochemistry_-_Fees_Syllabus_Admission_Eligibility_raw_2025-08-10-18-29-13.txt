M.Sc. in Biochemistry is a two-year postgraduate degree programme as per NEP-2020 that provides in-depth training in the field of biochemistry. The programme focuses on the study of biochemical processes and substances that occur within living organisms, including the chemical interactions between biological molecules, such as proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and lipids. It often includes professional development activities, such as writing scientific papers, presenting research findings, and networking with other researchers in the field. Graduates of M.Sc. Biochemistry programmes can pursue a wide range of academic and industry careers. These careers may include roles in research and development, quality control, regulatory affairs, or biotechnology. Graduates can also continue their education by pursuing a Ph.D. in biochemistry or related fields.
*M.Sc. (CW) - M.Sc. with Course Work
*M.Sc. (RW) - M.Sc. with Research Work
*M.Sc. (CW + RW) - M.Sc. with Course Work & Research Work
Programme Educational Objectives (PEO)
• PEO1: To provide in-depth knowledge in the core areas of life sciences for industries, clinical research, pharmaceutical labs, and academia.
• PEO2: To gain proficiency in laboratory techniques of various aspects of biochemistry and be able to apply processes of experimentation and hypothesis testing to biochemical methods.
• PEO3: To demonstrate analytical and problem-solving skills to combat human diseases and resolve problems in the field of agriculture.
• PEO4: To learn to work independently and as a team for retrieving information from various e-resources, carry out research investigations, and interpret.
• PEO5: To equip a skillful attitude promoting lifelong learning to meet the ever-evolving professional demands by developing ethical, interpersonal, and team skills.
