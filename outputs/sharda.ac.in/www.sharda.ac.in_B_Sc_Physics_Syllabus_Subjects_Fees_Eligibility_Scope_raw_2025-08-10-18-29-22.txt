B.Sc. in Physics is a three-year undergraduate program comprising of theory and experimental courses mainly from Physics and few interdisciplinary courses from Mathematics Chemistry and Computer Science.
The program emphasises on the fundamentals of Physics while introducing modern concepts such as Quantum Mechanics and Relativity proceeding over to Classical Mechanics Electrodynamics taking forward the courses like Electricity and Magnetism Optics and Waves similarly Statistical Mechanics and Thermodynamics.
The mission of the programme is to lay a strong foundation in classical and modern physics. Through the course curriculum and the opportunities to conduct individual research and field trips the students get holistic all-round development. They will also gain expertise in lab work through ample practical sessions training them at conception design and fabrication of laboratory equipment.
The undergraduate degree programme paves a solid ground for students to further acquire mastery in physics concentration areas. The programme trains graduate to establish entry-level careers in the government and private sectors.
Programme Educational Objectives (PEO)
• PEO1: To foster a strong foundation in theoretical and applied physics principles and theories to make students become globally competitive physicists.
• PEO2: To develop strong interest in physics by cultivating critical thinking and problem-solving skills in students so that they are motivated to pursue research and higher education in physics.
• PEO3: To emphasize on the interdisciplinary nature of physics and to integrate knowledge of other relevant disciplines to address a wide variety of problems through physics.
• PEO4: To train the students to design, execute record and analyse the results of physics experiments in line with physics principles and theories.
• PEO5: To create a sense of ethical responsibility among students towards the use of scientific knowledge for the benefit of humanity.
• PO1: Proficiency-Students will demonstrate proficiency in physics principles and concepts supported by sound understanding of underlying mathematical concepts and experimental results.
• PO2: Knowledge- Students will demonstrate knowledge of classical mechanics, optics, electromagnetism, quantum mechanics, nuclear physics, astrophysics, materials, statistical physics, electronics, biophysics, fluid mechanics, thermal physics, mathematics, calculus, physical chemistry, organic chemistry, inorganic chemistry, computer programming and be able to apply this knowledge to analyze a variety of physical phenomena.
• PO3: Skills- Students will show that they have learned laboratory skills, enabling them to take measurements in a physics laboratory and analyze the data to draw valid conclusions.
• PO4: Communication- Students will be capable of oral and written scientific communication and will prove that they can think critically and work independently.
• PO5: Research- Students shall have ability to take up higher education or work on interdisciplinary research problems
• PO6: Responsibility- Students shall have a clear understanding of professional and ethical responsibility
