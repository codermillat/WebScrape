B.Sc. in Biotechnology is a three-year undergraduate programme offering a strong foundation of biotechnological concepts. This programme is streamlined to endow students with an improved knowledge of the cellular and bi-molecular processes and study them through the development of a variety of technologies.
The programme prepares students with an analytical mindset to obtain valued solutions to harness the quality of life through major advances in health and medicine. The study module of biotechnology comprises genetics cell biology biomolecules plant and animal tissue culture immunology microbiology chemistry and engineering. The broad area of study involves research in biological systems and application of technology to create innovative products to advance life.
The meticulously structured programme has a strong interdisciplinary research base in biological sciences and engineering which prepares the student for the industry as well as research programmes. Graduates in this discipline significantly contribute to research and development to improve people s lives and health.
• PEO1: To create a foundation of various biological concepts and phenomena in the minds of students through theoretical and practical knowledge.
• PEO2: To keep students upgraded with new discoveries in biological world and inculcate continuous learning and self-improvement so that students are motivated for higher studies and research.
• PEO3: To teach the students various bio-techniques and application of these techniques for betterment of society and environment.
• PEO4: To make students industry- or academia-ready by developing independent thinking, good communication and scientific skills and to acquaint them with professional ethics so that they can work well in an industrial or academic environment.
• PEO5: To make students understand interdisciplinary nature of research in biotechnology by assigning them different research projects/ case studies/ presentations.
• PO1: Knowledge: Students will develop a sound understanding the biological systems and processes.
• PO2: Skill Set Development:The student will be skilled in various biological techniques that will enhance the employability of the students.
• PO3: Oral Communication and Scientific Writing: The students will be able to demonstrate good oral communication. Students will also be knowledgeable about writing technical (project report and reviews) content.
• PO4: Environment and Sustainable Development: Student will be able to realize the effect of human malpractices on environment and the need and importance of sustainable development.
• PO5: Ethics, Independent Thinking and Team Work: The students will develop professional ethics and also gain knowledge about various ethical issues associated with biotechnology. Students will learn to think and analyze a problem independently while at the same time realizing the importance of team work in carrying out successful research/ projects/ presentations.
