1. Structural Engineering
Structural Engineers face the challenge of designing structures that support their own weight and the loads they carry. These structures should be in a position to resist extreme forces from wind earthquakes bombings temperature and others. Bridges, buildings, amusement park rides and many other kinds of projects are included within this specialty. Structural Engineers develop appropriate combinations of steel concrete timber plastic and new exotic materials. They also plan and design and visit project sites to make sure work is done properly.
2. Environmental Engineering
The skills of Environmental Engineers have become increasingly important as we protect our fragile resources. Environmental Engineers translate physical chemical and biological processes into systems to destroy toxic substances, remove pollutants from water, reduce nonÂ¬-hazardous solid waste volumes, eliminate contaminants from the air and develop groundwater supplies. Environmental Engineers are called upon to resolve the problems of providing safe drinking water, cleaning up contaminated sites with hazardous materials, disposing of wastewater and managing solid wastes.
3. Geotechnical Engineering
Geotechnical Engineering is required in all aspects of Civil Engineering because most projects are supported by the ground. A Geotechnical Engineer may develop projects below the ground such as tunnels foundations and offshore platforms. They analyse the properties of soil and rock that support and affect the behaviour of these structures. They evaluate potential settlements of buildings, stability of slopes and fill seepage of groundwater and effects of earthquakes. They investigate rocks and soils at a project site and determine the best way to support a structure in the ground. They also take part in the design and construction of dams, embankments and retaining walls.
4. Fluid Mechanics and Hydrologic Engineering
Fluid mechanics is the branch of engineering science which deals with the behaviour of fluids under the conditions of rest and motion. Some of its applications for civil engineers include design of hydraulic structures, design of pumping and piping systems and design of fluid measuring instruments. Engineering hydrology deals with planning, design and operation of engineering projects for the control and use of water. Whereas, applied hydrology deals with hydrological cycle, precipitation, runoff, relationship between precipitation and runoff, hydrographs and flood management etc.
5. Transportation Engineering
The quality of a community is directly related to the quality of its transportation system. Transportation Engineers work to move people goods and materials safely and efficiently. They find ways to meet our ever-increasing travel needs on land, air and sea. They design, construct and maintain all types of transportation facilities including airports, highways, railroads, mass transit systems and ports. An important part of Transportation Engineering is upgrading our transportation capability by improving traffic control and mass transit systems and by introducing high speed trains people movers and other intermodal transportation methods.
6. Construction Engineering
The construction phase of a project represents the first tangible result of a design. Using technical and management skills Construction Engineers turn designs into reality on time and within budget. They apply their knowledge of construction methods and equipment along with the principles of financing planning and managing to turn the designs of other Engineers into successful facilities.

• The engineer and society: Apply reasoning informed by the contextual knowledge to assess societal, health, safety, legal and cultural issues and the consequent responsibilities relevant to the professional engineering practice.
• Environment and sustainability: Understand the impact of the professional engineering solutions in societal and environmental contexts, and demonstrate the knowledge of, and need for sustainable development.
• Ethics: Apply ethical principles and commit to professional ethics and responsibilities and norms of the engineering practice.
• Individual and team work: Function effectively as an individual, and as a member or leader in diverse teams, and in multidisciplinary settings.
• Communication: Communicate effectively on complex engineering activities with the engineering community and with society at large, such as, being able to comprehend and write effective reports and design documentation, make effective presentations, and give and receive clear instructions.
• Project management and finance: Demonstrate knowledge and understanding of the engineering and management principles and apply these to one’s own work, as a member and leader in a team, to manage projects and in multidisciplinary environments.
• Life-long learning: Recognize the need forand have the preparation and ability to engage in independent and life-long learning in the broadest context of technological change.
• PSO1: Plan, Analyze and Design sustainable infrastructure.
• PSO2: Build, manage and maintain construction projects adhering to the highest quality and safety standards.
• PSO3: Apply innovative and emerging technologies and tools to solve real world civil engineering problems for society.
This course is for individuals who...
Civil Engineering is one of the oldest and broadest of the Engineering disciplines extending across many specialties. Civil Engineers plan design and supervise the construction of facilities essential to modern life. These facilities vary widely in nature size scope and include bridges buildings tunnels highways transit systems dams airports harbors water supply systems and wastewater treatment plants.
