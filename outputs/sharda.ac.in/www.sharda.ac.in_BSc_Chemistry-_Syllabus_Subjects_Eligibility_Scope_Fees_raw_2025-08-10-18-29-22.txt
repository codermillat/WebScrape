B.Sc. in Chemistry is a three-year undergraduate programme designed for students to acquire theoretical knowledge and practical skills in different disciplines of chemistry. The programme consists of core theory along with laboratory programme as well as ability enhancement elective (AEEC) and compulsory (AECC) courses such as Computer Science and Functional English respectively. The programme comprises six semesters with 120 Credits.
The curriculum includes Core Courses(CC) as well as Discipline Specific Elective (DSE) and Generic Elective (GE) programmes and laboratory practicals. The programme also includes two courses offered by Physics and Mathematics Department. B. Sc Chemistry
Programme also includes Discipline Specific programme (DSE) and offers research project on an individual basis.
The programme provides guidance from leading professors to conduct extensive laboratory research projects and explore the chemical phenomena properties and reactivity. B.Sc. General degree is designed to provide a broad view of the discipline and can be followed with expertise in a special field.
Programme Educational Objectives (PEO)
• PEO 1: To produce graduates having a strong background of basic science, interdisciplinary Sciences and ability to use the knowledge and tools.
• PEO 2: To produce graduates who can demonstrate technical competence in the field of chemical sciences and develop solutions of the complex problems.
• PEO 3: To produce graduates having professional competence and skills in the field of science to serve the society globally.
• PEO 4: To produce researcher who function effectively in a multi-disciplinary environment within a societal and environmental context.
• PEO5: To produce graduates who would be able to take individual responsibility and work as a part of a team towards the fulfillment of both individual and organizational goals.
• PO1: Knowledge: Describe the fundamental scientific principles and apply the relevant knowledge of basic sciences especially chemical sciences to the problems of related to chemistry and emerge from the broader interdisciplinary subfields.
• PO2: Problem analysis: Identify, formulate, review research literature, and analyze complex problems reaching substantiated conclusions using principles of physical sciences, and chemical sciences.
• PO3: Design/development of solutions: Design experiments that meet the specified needs with appropriate consideration for the public health and safety, and the cultural, societal, and environmental considerations.
• PO4: Conduct investigations: Conduct laboratory experiments safely, use research-based knowledge, analysis and interpretation of data, and synthesis of the information to provide valid conclusions.
• PO5: Modern tools usage: Select, and apply appropriate techniques, resources, and modern software and ICT tools including prediction and modeling to complex scientific activities with an understanding of the limitations.
• PO6: Environment and sustainability: Understand the impact of the scientific solutions in societal and environmental contexts, and demonstrate the knowledge of, and need of sustainable development.
• PO7: Ethics: Apply ethical principles and commit to professional ethics and responsibilities and norms of the scientific practices.
• PO8: Individual and team work: Function effectively as an individual, and as a member or leader in diverse teams.
• PO9: Communication: Communicate effectively on complex scientific activities with community and with society at large, such as, being able to comprehend and write effective reports and design documentation, make effective presentations.
• PO10: Project management: Demonstrate knowledge and understanding of the chemical and biochemical principles and apply these to one’s own work, as a member and leader in a team, to manage projects.
• PO11: Life-long learning: Recognize the need for, and have the preparation and ability to engage in independent and life-long learning in the broadest context of technological changes.
This course is for individuals who...
have the capacity for problem-solving examining interpreting data and making evaluations based on limited data. Students with additional qualities of time management planning and executing experiments are a natural fit.
Students who are looking for...
exploring the fundamental nature of elements and the mechanism and processes involved in it

Career path you can choose after the course
Career path: A B.Sc. in Chemistry opens up diverse and promising career paths in both academic and professional domains. Graduates can pursue higher education such as M.Sc. or integrated Ph.D. programs in specialized areas like organic, inorganic, physical, analytical, or biochemistry, often leading to research and teaching roles in universities or research institutions. Those completing the Honours with Research track gain a competitive edge for Ph.D. admissions and roles requiring advanced research skills. In industry, opportunities exist as quality control analysts, R& D chemists, process developers, and environmental scientists across sectors like pharmaceuticals, petrochemicals, food processing, and cosmetics. The degree also enables roles in government agencies such as CSIR, DRDO, BARC, and forensic labs, or through civil services examinations. With the addition of interdisciplinary skills or a relevant minor (e.g., in AI or biology), graduates can explore careers in data science, scientific software development, regulatory affairs, and bioinformatics. Entrepreneurial ventures, science communication, or EdTech are also viable paths for those inclined toward innovation and outreach.
Take the next step towards a career in basic sciences.
