M.Tech. - Food Technology
2 Years
• Course Fee
M.Tech Food Technology is a postgraduate programme imparting lessons on nutritional value, biochemistry properties, and chemicals in different foods and packed food items. The programme aims at gaining in-depth knowledge regarding various traits of food process technology and its specializations. The students will gain lessons about the science of the safe production of nourishing food items from advanced raw materials. The salary of graduates in this programme ranges between INR 2 LPA to INR 9 LPA based on their skills, expertise, and experience. Students who further wish to continue their higher education can opt for Ph.D. in food process technology after completing their M.Tech.
