MD in Physiology at Sharda University is a three-year postgraduate programme that covers concepts related to human anatomy and physiology. During the programme, students gain knowledge of standard human disease processes and other allied-health subjects. The programme aims to develop an understanding of the function and structure of the critical systems of the human body and to increase the fundamental knowledge in areas of molecular biology, biostatistics, and biochemistry among students.
The curriculum of the programme is designed in such a way that it trains students for a successful career in the medical sciences by exploring the interrelationships of tissues, cells, and sub-cellular components. The course also includes some laboratory components like dissection, anatomical studies using microscopy, and the study of physiological concepts through experimentation. Some of the topics covered in the curriculum are the study of basic biochemistry, cells and tissues, anatomical terminologies, muscular, skeletal, nervous, cardiovascular, endocrine, urinary, immune, digestive, respiratory, and reproductive systems.
