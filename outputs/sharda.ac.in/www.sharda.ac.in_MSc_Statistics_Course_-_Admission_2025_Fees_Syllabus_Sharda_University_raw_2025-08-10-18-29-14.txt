The Master of Science (M.Sc.) in Statistics is a two-year full-time postgraduate programme that offers a comprehensive understanding of statistical theory, methodologies, and their real-world applications. Designed in alignment with the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, the programme equips students with robust analytical skills, data interpretation techniques, and proficiency in modern statistical software, enabling them to address complex challenges in science, industry, research, and governance. The curriculum integrates foundational and advanced topics, balancing rigorous theoretical training with practical, hands-on experience in areas such as data analysis, probability, distribution theory, regression analysis, statistical inference, reliability theory, and computational statistics. In addition, students gain exposure to emerging domains like data science, machine learning, and soft computing, alongside core statistical areas such as sampling theory, multivariate analysis, and stochastic processes. Through a blend of laboratory sessions, project work, and research oriented modules, the programme prepares students for diverse professional roles in academia, analytics, banking (RBI), healthcare, agriculture, social sciences, and national statistical systems, high profile job like UPSC (Indian Statistical Service, Deputy Director) as well as for Ph.D. research in Statistics and allied disciplines.
