This is a comprehensive undergraduate programme designed to provide a deep and rigorous understanding of mathematical theories, structures, and applications. It covers a wide range of core topics such as algebra, calculus, real and complex analysis, differential equations, linear algebra, and mathematical modelling, along with electives in areas like number theory, topology, and applied mathematics. The programme places strong emphasis on logical reasoning, problem-solving, and abstract thinking. The honors with research track offers students the opportunity to undertake independent research under faculty guidance, preparing them for advanced studies, academic research, or analytical roles in industry sectors such as finance, data science, and engineering.
Programme Educational Objectives (PEO’s)
• PEO1. Provide a solid foundation in mathematics, give a flavour of some very advanced modern branches of mathematics, and develop interdisciplinary skills.
• PEO2. Develop critical thinking, creative thinking, and self-confidence for eventual success in career
• PEO3. To prepare the students to communicate mathematical ideas effectively and develop their ability to collaborate both intellectually and creatively in diverse contexts.
• PEO4. Rewarding careers in private and government sectors such as Education, Industry, Banks, MNCs, and pursue higher studies.
