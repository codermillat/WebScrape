There will be specific Objectives for each year of the 4-year program. These objectives will be as follows:
In Year 1, the students will be taught the basic sciences, basic history taking and physical examination techniques and be introduced to longitudinal case work-up, though at a very basic level. In addition, they will be taught what many members of the public should know, viz. the basic core skills of first-aid, CPR and defibrillation, but with a clear understanding of the theoretical basis. They will also be introduced to ambulances, the Emergency Department and the satellite community healthcare clinics and also the basic principles of disaster management, including community first responder skills.
In Year 2, the students will begin to examine patients. They will be taught to recognize the signs of common emergency conditions and introduced to the basis for treatments and follow-up care. In addition, because emergency paramedics are meant to be role models in basic resuscitation techniques, they will be refreshed on these skills and also introduced to the principles of advanced life support. Longitudinal Case work-up will continue and for Year 2, students will be expected to attain Level 3 proficiency by the end of the year. They will also be introduced to practical simulation training and taught to assist in ambulances, Emergency Departments and Community Healthcare Clinics. For disaster management, they will be trained to become members of on-site disaster medical teams. They will also be trained in ambulance organization and casualty evacuation.
In Year 3, the students will be spending a significant proportion of their time in the clinical wards, Emergency Departments and Ambulances to apply the principles they had learnt in their first two years to the clinical environment in a supervised environment. Body system topics not covered in the first two years will be completed in this third year.
Year 4 will be an internship year during which they will be using the knowledge and skills they have acquired during their first three years in the clinical environment. In addition, they will continue to teach younger colleagues and community residents the basic core skills of first-aid, CPR and defibrillation. They will only be signed off after satisfactory completion of their internship postings.
