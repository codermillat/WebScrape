I did my undergrad in Psychology at Sharda, and it was a genuinely good experience. The faculty was knowledgeable and supportive, especially if you were curious and willing to put in the effort. We got great exposure to research, group projects, and presentations, which really helped later when I moved into data and growth roles. The campus is diverse, which made for a fun and eye-opening three years. You meet people from all over, and that kind of environment pushes you to grow, not just academically but personally as well. Overall, Id say Sharda gave me a solid foundation and direction. If you make the most of the opportunities, youll come out stronger for it.
