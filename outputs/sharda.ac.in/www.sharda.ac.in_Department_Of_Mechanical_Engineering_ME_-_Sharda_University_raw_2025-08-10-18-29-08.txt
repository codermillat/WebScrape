Our department of mechanical engineering is one of the broadest and oldest in the Sharda School of Engineering and Technology, which is constantly evolving with advancements in technology, especially in Automotive Electrical Vehicles, Mechatronics, and Digital Manufacturing. The department offers B. Tech Mechanical Engineering and M. Tech Mechanical Engineering. In addition to theoretical coursework, mechanical engineering students also have access to well-equipped laboratories such as the Mechanical Simulation Laboratory, Computer-Aided Design and Drafting, Mechanical Workshop, Manufacturing Technology Laboratory, Mechanics of Machines and Solids Laboratory, Fluid Mechanics and Turbo Machinery Laboratory, Heat Transfer and RAC Laboratory, IC Engines, Automobile Engineering, and Mechatronics Engineering Laboratory, where they can gain hands-on experience in testing and evaluating mechanical systems. These laboratories include facilities for design simulation, materials testing, thermal testing, fluid mechanics, advance machining processes, automobile engineering and control systems.
Department has well qualified faculty members from various reputed institutions such as IITs, NITs, NSTU, JMI, VIT and BITS. Faculty members have strong holdings in publishing research articles in high impact factor peer review journals, patents, design registrations, handling government funded projects given by SERB-DST, DRDO, India, serving consultancy projects from industries.
Team Tornadoes Racing is the official Baja Racing team of Sharda University Mechanical Engineering students, which participates in various Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) events. It has an SAE Collegiate Club comprising of 50+ students from all four years who volunteer their time and talents to conceive the design and build small-scale All-Terrain Vehicles (ATVs) for SAE events under the able guidance of faculty members. The Team Tornadoes racing is an entirely student-run competition team, and every year, they design and manufacture a new race vehicle. The objective of Team Tornadoes racing is to take our university’s young aspiring Mechanical Engineers to push their limits so that they can strengthen their minds to improvise theoretical knowledge in today's life. Department has also registered the chapter in the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers) under which various events are organized yearly to aware of applied fluid and thermal engineering roles in the industries.

Students Participation in International & National Competitions:
• Mechanical Engineering Department Sharda University has been one among five universities in India who has been shortlisted for NASA 2020 Rover Contest.
• The students of the Mechanical Engineering participate in the BAJA SAE and ESI SAE every year. Student team Secured 1st position in acceleration segment in BAJA SAEINDIA-2020 held at Chitkara University, Chandigarh and won prize of Rs. 60000/- & secured 2st Position in North India and 6th position in all over India in ESI-SAE-2020 held at Pune.
• Students of Mechanical Engineering participated in SIH-2019 final round with an idea for the solution is to mount strain gauge load cell on either side of four leaf springs (front and rear). So, the total number of load cell becomes 8 which is sufficient for the measurement of weight transferred to leaf springs from vehicle chassis.
Foreign Exchange Program:
• Abinash Adhikary’ Student of Mechanical Engineering Department Sharda University went to Manisa Celal Bayar University, Manisa, Turkey for foreign exchange program.
• Mariana Pereira student of Federal University of Federal de Juiz de Fora completed 7th semester at Department of Mechanical Engineering Sharda University through Foreign Exchange Program.
• Two Students Opted B.Tech Mechanical Engineering Program from Cincinnati University under Migration
Hands on Students Training by Industry Expert:
• Department has a collaboration with Automobile Training Academy. Wherein students are Trained by Industry Experts On Contemporary Industry Driven Automobile Skills.
Industry-Academia Collaboration:
• Students of Mechanical Engineering are working on real time industrial projects with the following companies:
Indoplast Pvt Ltd., Greater Noida
Anmol Biscuits Pvt. Ltd., Greater Noida
Advance Valve Pvt. Ltd., Greater Noida
