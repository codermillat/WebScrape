The graduate Dental education programmes at Sharda University offer opportunities to prepare students for a career in research & academia or speciality clinical practice. The course of study includes lectures, demonstrations, seminars, and clinical experiences leading to student's professional and personal growth & development. The students are introduced to a broad range of clinical procedures rather than focusing on a single method of treatment which prepares them to manage a diversity of cases and use varying treatment modalities.
The dental courses offer graduate study options in more than nine dental specialities like prosthodontics, microbiology, human anatomy, physiology & biochemistry, dental material, embryology & histology, general & dental pharmacology and pathology, periodontics, pedodontics, orthodontics and dentistry. We have hand-picked faculty based on their excellence in their dedicated discipline enabling them to teach and mentor bright students.
• Bachelor of Dental Surgery
I was always told in my childhood that college days are the best days. When I joined School of Dental Sciences, Sharda University for my undergraduate programme, I realised how true the saying was. Living in a campus with such diverse culture and so many different extra curriculum activities, you learn so much about life and that helps you grow and become wise as a person. Joining Sharda University has been the best decision for my career prospects and has indeed been the best experience of my life.
Sharda University is a great home -away-from- home anyone could ever have. What a great atmosphere- what a great bunch of students- what an institute what an incredible staff! I am glad, I am part of this truly global university

BDS, 3rd Year
I am a proud Shardan who had an enriching learning experience during both my undergraduate and post graduate time. The faculties here are experts in their field and were able to extract the best out of me. I have been able to reinvent myself into a more confident individual and able to broaden my horizons. I can proudly say that Sharda University has made me a better person individually as well as professionally. I am blessed to be a part of Sharda family.

Sharda University has been a turning point to my career.
