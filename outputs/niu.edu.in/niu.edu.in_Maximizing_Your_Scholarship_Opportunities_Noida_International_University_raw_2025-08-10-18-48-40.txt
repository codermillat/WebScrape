The aim of NIU scholarship is to provide an opportunity for world-class education to all deserving students who are academically brilliant but do not have the financial means to pursue a good education.

With this in view and in order to attract talented and progressive minds, the University offers generous scholarships to meritorious students. It believes in honing the skills of brilliant minds in order to help develop capable leaders for organizations, communities, and societies at large.
Through its scholarships, NIU strives to provide access to an environment conducive to great academic achievement and also to the overall development of one’s personality. The hard work and academic excellence achieved by meritorious students is duly rewarded at NIU in the form of scholarships.
