It makes it simple for the students by telling them step-by-step procedures. It also mentions the documents required for both National and international students.
Noida International University course admissions to the programs offered at NIU happen through the NSAT (NIU Scholarship cum Admission Test) for Technical Programs or through GD/PI for non-technical programs. We also consider State-level and National-level entrance exams like JEE & CUET.

Our whole application process is online, and our payment process is both online and offline. It is recommended that the applications be completed in all aspects and submitted for Noida International University admission along with the required documents.
