Training & Placement Process
Recruiters
The placement process is manifold. It includes personality development, gap identification, mock interviews, pre-placement counselling, CV formation, and live projects and internships. During their academic tenure, the students go through a well-planned, rigorous course curriculum along with real-life practical training and internships in reputed research institutes and/or corporate houses.
The academic curriculum is so structured that it requires the students to undergo a mandatory summer internship of 6–8 weeks with reputed organizations. The internship helps the students apply their classroom learning of theoretical concepts to real-life management settings. This process enables them to sharpen their ability to diagnose, analyze and resolve problems. The option of short-term live projects with leading companies is also provided to the students. This runs parallel to their academic sessions and gives them valuable insight into the workings of the industry.
Since its inception, NIU continues to maintain a consistently impressive placement record. It has been able to assist students to pursue careers in their dream companies and become successful leaders. It continues to do so each year, moving from strength to strength surely and consistently.
