The School of Allied Health Sciences associated with the on-campus 750 bedded NIIMS multispecialty hospital is to improve the health and wellbeing of all nations through exemplary and culturally sensitive teaching, innovative research, and patient care. The Institute of Allied Health Sciences envisages producing a diverse, interprofessionally skilled workforce of healthcare practitioners, educators, researchers, and healthcare leaders. Our college of health sciences aims to conduct research to generate new knowledge that advances the practices and policies of health care.

Our graduates assume rewarding careers as dieticians, medical technologists, physical and occupational therapists, clinical and rehabilitation counsellors, and radiographers, among others. With such diversity, the SOAHS role is integral in transforming health care, not just nationally or internationally but also in local communities.
I am proud to support our mission and to represent the talented and diverse students, faculty, and staff who make SOAHS so vital and important. I urge you to take a few moments to explore our many programs and services.
