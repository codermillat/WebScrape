Pharmacy is a subject that deals with the techniques of preparing and dispensing drugs. Pharmacy degrees teach students how different types of drugs affect the human body and mind and how they interact when mixed together. So, in order to successfully study Pharmacy, you’ll have to make Chemistry your friend.
Pharmacy studies will involve spending time in laboratories, researching, and learning about the chemistry used to develop medication. Some of the courses covered by this degree consist of: Pharmaceutics, Medicinal Chemistry, Pharmacognosy, and Pharmacy Practice.
Students will learn about the fundamentals of pharmaceutical sciences. They will gain knowledge from related fields, such as Medicine, Chemistry, Biology, and even Ethics. During the final years of study, the approach will shift from theory towards practice. You will also have to do individual research projects and present your findings.

A pharmacist's role does not end there. They conduct market research and keep track of all medicines and products by interacting with a medical practitioner and distributors for any adverse effects, reactions, allergies, and so on. Although medications are evaluated in labs before being distributed in a market, due to the complexity and diversity of human individuals, different outcomes from the same medicine might occur; consequently, a pharmacy practitioner must research and develop medicines and prescriptions at several levels. Pharmacy encompasses everything linked to your well-being, from the food you eat to the cosmetics, lifestyle products, health, and chemical items you use.
Looking at the scope of Pharmacy in the healthcare industry, according to a survey report called ‘Pharmacy at a Glance 2015-2017' by the International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP), the pharmacy community is the largest contributor, with 75.1 percent of registered pharmacists employed, followed by hospital pharmacy with 13.2 percent. The services provided by pharmacy practitioners include:
Improving the use of medicines: Reviewing medicines, medicines for hypertension management, directly observed treatments, short course-based medicines, medication reconciliation, and new drug development.
Product-focused services: This includes compounding medicines (based on prescriptions by medical practitioners) and assembling expired medicines from a market.
Public health services: This includes promoting health initiatives, vaccinations, health camps, and other health -related awareness.
The World Health Organization (WHO) in India is aiming to strengthen the pharmaceutical sector, including drug regulations, volume, and trade, to facilitate the pharmaceuticals becoming crucial for India’s growth. The WHO in close association with the Government of India, controls the strengths and collaborations for improving the pharmaceutical sector.
For making the WHO 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda a success, access to medicines is a critical factor. Thus, WHO India’s key strategy is to strengthen the Regulatory system that can help access quality, safe, effective, and inexpensive medical products in an unbiased manner. Moreover, WHO India is also effectively working on establishing pharmacovigilance systems by integrating public health programmes, promoting rational drug use initiatives for medical products through the National Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance, as well as strengthening procurement and supply chain management.
