At NIU, emphasis is given on not only making you academically brilliant but also true leaders and team players, thus preparing you for the real life of the legal world. Be a part of the best law and legal affairs college near you in Delhi-NCR, Noida.
“If you think education is expensive, try ignorance.”
It is my firm belief that there are, in the contemporary world, challenges, socio-economic and political, that, if the legal system cannot meet them, will destroy it. These challenges are not the creation of legal professionals, nor can they be suppressed by them. They have to be met either by discarding or by adjusting our legal system. I believe that our education law should address the contemporary challenges effectively so as to adjust to the systemic needs.
In any given society, the law plays a vital role in regulating the affairs of the state, including those of corporate and business management. In our country, we have immense talent among the youth, and all that is required is to guide and bring out the best in them. The paramount thrust is to create an international academic bridge by blending the advanced knowledge and modern teaching tools with the rich traditional values, culture, and heritage. The aim can be achieved only with the support of one and all.
Wishing you luck for your future endeavours.

Mr. Dheeraj Kumar Jha
Myself Neha Singh from B.A. LL.B IInd Sem. Noida International University is really good you would be provided with ample amount of amenities in the college. Being a student of law I got opportunities to participate in two National Moot Courts in my First and Second Semester only. Their law library provides a good compilation of legal resources and most importantly the legal aids camps organised by SLLA, NIU with the aim of Awareness Drive to sensitize the residents about the Legal Aid Clinic in the vicinity of the college campus that provides free legal aid.
Coming to Noida International University as a foreign law students is my best decision. The curriculum is very good and jam-packed. Course provides a holistic learning for an individual, the campus is good and beautiful too. Faculty for each of the courses excel in their spheres and thus are the best mentors for the students. Along with class room teaching the faculty also encourage additional learning activities such as debates, research papers etc
“Noida International University is the best place for people who want to make the most out of their university life. Noida International University has a beautiful architectural structure. When one misses their family, the NIU Building is a perfect location to get lost. The campus takes prides in its massively amazing Central Library named as “CHARLES DARWIN” and the plus point was that NIU having the library in each and every department which help the students to enhance their skills. The Library Resources are the greatest treasure trove for reading and researching for assignments and projects. The lecturers are super friendly and patient, and the lectures are delivered through hybrid means. While exam week is a little stressful (same as exam week everywhere), the support provided by the professors goes beyond appreciation.”
“Everything about Noida International University is great. The facilities, the staff, the location is a perfect one for students, the lecturers go above and beyond and I like how there is consistent student and faculty support especially for international students. I really love the atmosphere and ambiance on campus- it's just lovely and calm. Above all, the students' union is just the best. I highly recommend the University for giving an opportunity to enjoy every moment (educational trip, sports meet, cultural activities, fests, etc.) and guiding me to shaping my career.”
I have been at Noida International University since past 3 years and by each passing day, I discovered the best version of myself at NIU.
College is cycle of stripped identity in which we continuously challenge our minds, step outside our comfort zones, and sometimes lapse into being lost. Without this environment, I would not have a foundation to feel grounded ever so often. Pursuing Law from school of law and legal affairs, Noida International University was the best decision of my life because here under one roof, a student can find ample amount of opportunities with academic excellence going hand in hand. Students like us get the best guidance of talented faculty members not only in academics but in all round development of a student. We get opportunities to develop our skills such as Moot courts, debate competition, Quiz competition etc. Also, we get Internship guidance, Career development classes etc. Your search for being the best will end up reaching here. "BE THE BEST AT NIU"
