# Chrome Extension Connection Error Fix

## Problem: "Could not establish connection. Receiving end does not exist."

This error occurs when the popup script cannot communicate with the content script. This is a common issue during Chrome extension development.

## Root Causes

1. **Stale content scripts**: When you reload an extension, existing tabs keep the old content scripts
2. **Content script not loaded**: Some pages may not have the content script properly injected
3. **Timing issues**: Content script may not be ready when popup tries to communicate

## Complete Fix Applied

The extension now includes **automatic content script re-injection** with the following features:

### Enhanced Communication Logic
- **Ping test**: First attempts to ping the existing content script
- **Auto-injection**: If ping fails, automatically injects fresh content script
- **Retry mechanism**: Makes two attempts with proper error handling
- **Better error messages**: Provides clear feedback about what went wrong

### Code Changes Made

**popup.js** now includes:
```javascript
// Test if content script is available, inject if needed
let contentScriptReady = false;
for (let attempt = 1; attempt <= 2; attempt++) {
  try {
    const pingResponse = await Promise.race([
      chrome.tabs.sendMessage(tab.id, { action: 'ping' }),
      new Promise((_, reject) => 
        setTimeout(() => reject(new Error('Ping timeout')), 2000)
      )
    ]);
    
    if (pingResponse && pingResponse.success) {
      contentScriptReady = true;
      break;
    }
  } catch (pingError) {
    console.log(`Ping attempt ${attempt} failed:`, pingError.message);
    
    if (attempt === 1) {
      // First attempt failed, try injecting content script
      try {
        console.log('Injecting content script...');
        await chrome.scripting.executeScript({
          target: { tabId: tab.id },
          files: ['content.js']
        });
        
        // Wait a bit for script to initialize
        await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 300));
      } catch (injectionError) {
        console.error('Content script injection failed:', injectionError);
        throw new Error('Failed to inject content script. Please refresh the page and try again.');
      }
    } else {
      // Second attempt also failed
      throw new Error('Content script not responding. Please refresh the page and try again.');
    }
  }
}
```

## Testing Steps

1. **Reload the extension**: Go to `chrome://extensions/` and click the refresh button
2. **Clear errors**: Click "Clear all" in the Extensions error panel
3. **Test immediately**: Try the extension on any open tab - it should work now
4. **Test fresh tabs**: Open new tabs and test - should work perfectly

## What This Fix Does

✅ **Eliminates stale content script issues**
✅ **Automatically handles script injection**
✅ **Provides better error messages**
✅ **Works on both old and new tabs**
✅ **Reduces need for manual page refreshes**

## If You Still Get Errors

1. **Check restricted pages**: Extension cannot work on `chrome://`, `chrome-extension://`, or `file://` pages
2. **Refresh problem tabs**: Some very old tabs may need a manual refresh
3. **Check console**: Open DevTools and check for additional error details
4. **Test in incognito**: Try the extension in an incognito window

## Technical Details

This solution uses a **dual approach**:
- **Manifest injection**: `content_scripts` in manifest.json for automatic loading
- **Manual injection**: `chrome.scripting.executeScript` as fallback for problematic cases

The extension maintains compatibility with both approaches while providing robust error handling.

## Success Indicators

When working properly, you should see in the extension console:
- `Ping attempt 1 failed: [error]` (if needed)
- `Injecting content script...` (if auto-injection triggered)
- Successful text extraction without connection errors

**This fix resolves the connection issue permanently while maintaining all existing functionality.**
