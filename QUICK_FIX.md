# ðŸš€ QUICK FIX - Connection Error Resolved!

## âœ… **Issue Identified & Fixed**

The **"Could not establish connection"** error was caused by a misconfiguration in `manifest.json`.

## ðŸ”§ **What Was Wrong**
- `text-processor.js` was incorrectly included in content scripts
- This caused conflicts when the content script tried to load
- Result: Popup couldn't communicate with content script

## ðŸŽ¯ **What Was Fixed**
1. âœ… **Removed** `text-processor.js` from content scripts in `manifest.json`
2. âœ… **Enhanced** error handling in `popup.js`
3. âœ… **Added** automatic content script injection
4. âœ… **Added** debugging logs and connection testing

## ðŸ“‹ **To Apply the Fix**

### Step 1: Reload Extension
1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Find "Web Text Extractor"
3. Click the **reload/refresh** button ðŸ”„

### Step 2: Test It
1. Go to any website (e.g., `https://example.com`)
2. Click the extension icon
3. Click **"Extract Text"**
4. âœ… Should work without errors!

## ðŸŽ‰ **Expected Results**

- âœ… No more "Could not establish connection" errors
- âœ… Text extraction works on regular websites
- âœ… Clear error messages for restricted pages (chrome:// etc.)
- âœ… Better debugging and error handling

## ðŸš« **Still Won't Work On**

These are **intentionally restricted** by Chrome security:
- `chrome://` pages (extensions, settings, etc.)
- Local `file://` pages
- Chrome Web Store pages

**This is normal and expected behavior!**
